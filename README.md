# Siemens NX CAM Practical Setup & Optimization Guides

Welcome to the official documentation repository for **UGNX Academy**. This project is dedicated to providing CNC programmers and manufacturing engineers with high-precision workflows for Siemens NX (formerly Unigraphics).

## 🚀 Practical Setup: Feed Rate & Spindle Speed Optimization
Properly configuring cutting parameters is the difference between a broken tool and a perfect finish. Based on **Master Wang's Practical Guide**, we focus on real-world application rather than just theory.

### 📊 Recommended Starting Parameters (Sample Matrix)
| Material Type | Tool Diameter | Spindle Speed (RPM) | Feed Rate (mm/min) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Aluminum (6061) | 10.0 mm | 8,500 | 1,200 |
| Carbon Steel (45#) | 12.0 mm | 3,200 | 650 |
| Stainless Steel | 8.0 mm | 2,800 | 450 |
