<p><br>    Hello everyone, I'm Master Wang. Last lesson, we covered Planar Milling. This time, we'll continue our discussion and dive into "Planar Profile Milling." Don't let the similar name fool you; there's a lot more to it, especially some practical tricks you won't find in textbooks. Today, I'll break it down and explain everything clearly for you.<br></p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Command Overview: What Exactly is Planar Profile Milling?</h2><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Don't Get Confused: It's All About the "Edges and Sides"</h3><br><p><br>    Listen up: Planar Profile Milling, as the name suggests, is primarily used for machining the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"profiles" or "side walls"</strong> of a workpiece. Unlike the broad, aggressive roughing of standard Planar Milling, Planar Profile Milling is more like a precision edge-finishing specialist. It can only follow the contour lines you select, such as the side wall of a slot or the outer edge of a boss.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC26%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-machining-01.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>    For example, if you have a small slot, 18 mm wide, and you use a ∅10 tool to mill it, Planar Profile Milling will only follow the two side walls of the slot, finishing them or roughing the side wall stock. It won't clear out the entire interior of the slot like Planar Milling would. You absolutely *must* distinguish this, otherwise, you'll make mistakes!<br></p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第26节课  三轴/planar-profile-milling-wangs-practical-playbook-01.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">It Can Handle Roughing and Finishing, But Your Approach Must Be Correct</h3><br><p><br>    This command isn't picky; it can be used for <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">roughing</strong> the stock on side walls, for a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">finishing pass</strong> on side walls, and even for chamfering. The key is to have the right "approach." When you want to machine the side of a particular contour, this command comes into play. But remember, its core function is to follow the contour, not for planar Corner Cleanup or floor clearing.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC26%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-machining-02.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>    You can think of it as a specialized function within the larger framework of Planar Milling in NX, specifically for machining "boundary walls." Use it flexibly, and you'll save a lot of trouble; but use it incorrectly, and you'll run into big problems.<br></p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Core Settings: Part Boundaries and Toolpath Direction</h2><br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第26节课  三轴/planar-profile-milling-wangs-practical-playbook-02.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Curve Selection: Order is Key, Never Skip Around</h3><br><p><br>    Let's go straight into the NX interface and select "Planar Profile Milling." The first step is to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Specify Part Boundaries."</strong> Here, select the "Curve" method, which is the most commonly used.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC26%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-machining-03.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>    <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Listen closely, this is critical!</strong> When selecting the curves that form the profile, you must <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">select them sequentially and continuously</strong>. For a closed contour, for example, you need to click each segment in order along one direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise). For an open contour, also select them sequentially along the tool's travel direction.<br></p>
<br><p><br>    <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Remember, never skip around!</strong> For instance, if you select one line here, then jump to another line over there, NX will assume you want to connect these two lines for machining, leading to a chaotic toolpath or even an error. This is something textbooks don't teach, and it's a common rookie mistake in actual operation!<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC26%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-machining-04.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Toolpath Direction: The Small Circle Dictates Inside or Outside!</h3><br><p><br>    After selecting the curves, let's look at the "Tool Side" option. Here you'll see a small circle, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">which indicates on which side of the selected curve the tool center will be.</strong><br></p>
<br><ul><br>    <li>If the small circle is on the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">outside</strong>, it means the tool will move <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">to the outside</strong> of the contour, which will almost certainly cause "overcutting" and scrap your workpiece!</li><br>    <li>If the small circle is on the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">inside</strong>, the tool will move <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">to the inside</strong> of the contour, which is typically what we want.</li><br></ul><br><p><br>    Therefore, if you ever notice something off with the toolpath, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">the first thing to check is whether the "Tool Side" is set to "Left" or "Right."</strong> Based on the geometry you're actually machining, select the correct direction to ensure the tool is cutting on the inside of the contour.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC26%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/planar-profile-milling-wangs-practical-playbook-01.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>    Then, for <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Specify Bottom Face,"</strong> this is the same as Planar Milling; just select the bottom plane you want to machine, no need to elaborate.<br></p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第26节课  三轴/planar-profile-milling-wangs-practical-playbook-03.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Pitfall Alert: No Software Error Doesn't Mean No "Scrap"</h3><br><p><br>    Let me tell you a plain truth: when generating these contour toolpaths, if you select the wrong "Tool Side," NX (and many other CAM software packages) <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">won't necessarily throw an error immediately</strong>! It will dutifully generate a toolpath that "runs outwards." The moment that hits the machine, it's not "cutting," it's "scrapping" the part! At best, you'll ruin the part; at worst, you'll damage the tool or even the machine.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC26%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/planar-profile-milling-wangs-practical-playbook-02.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>    So, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">don't just rely on software simulation; review the toolpath multiple times, paying close attention to the position of that small circle</strong>. "Simulate" with your eyes. Developing this habit can save you significant machining costs and time.<br></p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Lead-in/Lead-out Optimization: Say Goodbye to "Plunge-in" and "Air Cutting"</h2><br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第26节课  三轴/planar-profile-milling-wangs-practical-playbook-04.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Linear Lead-in/Lead-out: Smooth Engagement, Protect the Tool</h3><br><p><br>    With the initial generated toolpath, you might find the tool "plunging" directly into the material, or after finishing one area, it lifts instantly and "jumps" to a distant spot before plunging in again. Such "plunging" and "air cutting" are not only inefficient but also prone to damaging the tool and reducing surface quality.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC26%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/planar-profile-milling-wangs-practical-playbook-03.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>    The solution lies within <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Non-Cutting Moves,"</strong> specifically under the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Lead-in/Lead-out"</strong> options.<br></p>
<br><ul><br>    <li>Change the default "Arc" lead-in/lead-out to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Linear,"</strong> so the tool enters and exits the cut at a smooth, gradual angle.</li><br>    <li>Set the angle typically to around <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">5 degrees</strong>, and the length to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">75%</strong> of the tool diameter (or adjust according to actual conditions). This way, the tool "slides" in rather than "plunging" in, which benefits both tool life and machining stability.</li><br></ul><br><p><br>    If multiple cutting layers are needed, this is usually set under "Cutting Depth," which follows a similar logic to Planar Milling, so I won't elaborate further here. By adjusting the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">stepover</strong>, for example, by making the tool machine the side wall in three passes, this ensures the proper <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Depth of Cut (DOC)</strong> and reduces the load on each individual pass.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC26%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/planar-profile-milling-wangs-practical-playbook-04.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Multi-Region Machining: One Region, One Boundary</h2><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Crucial! Add New Boundary or Press Middle Mouse Button</h3><br><p><br>    Often, our workpieces have multiple independent contours that need machining. For instance, after milling the inner side wall of one slot, you might want to mill the outer side wall of another boss.<br></p>
<br><p><br>    <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Here's another common mistake beginners make!</strong> If you simply continue selecting new curves, NX will assume you want to "connect" the previously selected boundaries with the newly selected ones. The result will be erratic toolpaths, or they might not generate at all.<br></p>
<br><p><br>    The correct procedure is: after you complete the curve selection for one contour region, you <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">must click the "Add New Boundary" button, or, more quickly, press the "middle mouse button"</strong> once. This is equivalent to telling the software: "I've finished selecting the boundaries for this region; now I want to define a new, independent machining area."<br></p>
<br><p><br>    After adding a new boundary, proceed as described earlier: sequentially select the curves for the new region and check the "Tool Side" direction. This way, different contour regions will generate correct toolpaths independently, without interference. This is much faster and more reliable than having to rework and modify the program afterward.<br></p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Summary: Pitfall Avoidance Guide</h3><br><ul><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Clarify Purpose:</strong> Planar Profile Milling is *only* for machining "side walls" or "profiles"; don't use it to clear out an entire planar area.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Consecutive Curve Selection:</strong> When "Specifying Part Boundaries," curves within the same region must be selected sequentially and continuously; do not skip selections.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Check Tool Side:</strong> Always observe the position of the small circle to ensure the tool is cutting on the inside (or your desired side) of the contour, preventing overcutting. No software error does *not* mean the toolpath is correct!</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Separate Multi-Regions:</strong> When machining multiple unconnected contour regions, after completing the selection for one region, you <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">must click "Add New Boundary" or press the "middle mouse button"</strong> to define the boundaries of different regions separately.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Optimize Lead-in/Lead-out:</strong> In "Non-Cutting Moves," under "Lead-in/Lead-out" settings, change the default arc to linear and adjust the angle and length to achieve smooth tool engagement and reduce tool impact.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Develop a Checking Habit:</strong> After every toolpath generation, simulate and observe repeatedly. Use the experience of a seasoned machinist to judge if the toolpath is reasonable, instead of blindly trusting the software.</li><br></ul><br><p><br>    Alright, that concludes today's practical essentials for Planar Profile Milling. These are all experiences I, Master Wang, have distilled from fifteen years in the trenches. Remember them, and you'll navigate machining with far fewer detours and mistakes. Go ahead, digest this information thoroughly, because practice is where true knowledge is gained!<br></p>
