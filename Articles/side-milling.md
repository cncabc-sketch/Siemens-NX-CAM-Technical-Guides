<h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Side Milling: An Efficiency Powerhouse in Practice</h2><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">What is Side Milling? Stop Calling It "Corner Cleanup"!</h3><br>Alright folks, listen up! Today we're continuing from our last discussion on planar milling and profile milling, but what we're covering this time isn't just a simple "Corner Cleanup" operation. I've noticed some of the younger generation confusing these, and that simply won't do! What we're talking about today is the real deal: <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Side Milling"</strong>.<br><br>"Corner Cleanup" is just that—it's for removing residual material from corners. "Side Milling," on the other hand, is more like an efficient Roughing or semi-finishing method, especially suited for clearing large areas of excess material on the outer or inner sides of a part. Its core idea is to utilize the tool's <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">side cutting edge</strong> for machining, gradually stepping into the workpiece, much like <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">dynamic milling</strong> (or trochoidal milling) on a CNC machine. It doesn't plunge and take the entire Depth of Cut at once; instead, it works in layers or steps, advancing laterally. This method is highly efficient and ensures uniform tool loading.<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Boundary and Stock Material Handling: Using a 5mm Roughing Allowance as an Example</h3><br>Let's say we're starting with stock material cut from the outside, for instance, a part profile cut by a laser cutting machine. While laser cutting offers high precision, for subsequent Finishing, we typically leave a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">3 to 5 mm</strong> allowance on each side. This time, I'll use a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">5 mm</strong> single-side allowance as an example to thoroughly explain how to efficiently remove it using side milling.<br><br>When facing this type of external stock material, you could certainly use planar profile milling, as we discussed before, cutting layer by layer from the top down, engaging with the tool's end face. However, that method is less efficient and often leads to uneven tool wear. The better approach is to use side milling; it allows you to remove this stock with fewer toolpaths and a much more stable cutting posture.<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第30节课  三轴/side-milling-01.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">In-Depth Analysis of Siemens NX Side Milling Parameters</h2><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Geometry Selection and Machining Region Definition</h3><br>First, access the "Side Milling" command in Siemens NX. This command's interface is quite similar to planar milling, so don't panic. The first step is to select the geometry you intend to machine.<br><br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Specify Boundary</strong>: Click "Select Curves" and choose all the profile boundaries you want to machine. Pay attention here: if the default "Tangent Connectivity" doesn't work, then simply use <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Single Selection</strong> and click each individual line segment. The system will automatically "project" these boundary lines onto your specified plane, using them as the machining path.<br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Machining Region</strong>: After selecting the boundaries, the system will ask if you want to machine the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">inside</strong> or the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">outside</strong>. Since we're clearing external stock, we'll choose <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Outside</strong>.<br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Specify Plane</strong>: The start plane is usually the top face of the workpiece, and the bottom plane is the depth you intend to machine to.<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Core Algorithm for Toolpath Stepover and Additional Passes</h3><br>Next are the most critical parameters for "Side Milling," these are practical tips not often found in textbooks, so listen up:<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第30节课  三轴/side-milling-02.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Stepover</strong>: This parameter determines the lateral feed distance for each cut. The default value is typically <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0.5mm</strong>. This means the tool moves 0.5mm deeper into the workpiece with each pass.<br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Additional Passes</strong>: This is paramount! It determines how many extra cuts are made besides the first one. There's a little trick here, so pay close attention to the calculation:<br>    *   Suppose we want to clear <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">5mm</strong> of single-side stock, with a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0.5mm</strong> Stepover per pass.<br>    *   Theoretically, 5mm ÷ 0.5mm/pass = 10 passes.<br>    *   However, "Additional Passes" here refers to the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">number of extra toolpaths added beyond the first pass</strong>. So, if a total of 10 passes are needed to remove the 5mm, then the additional passes should be 10 - 1 = <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">9 passes</strong>.<br>    *   Similarly, if we want to clear <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">3mm</strong> of stock, with a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0.5mm</strong> Stepover:<br>        *   3mm ÷ 0.5mm/pass = 6 passes.<br>        *   The additional passes would be 6 - 1 = <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">5 passes</strong>.<br>    *   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Remember: Don't count the first pass as "additional," otherwise, you might remove too much or too little stock!</strong><br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Cutting Pattern</strong>: When using "Side Milling," Siemens NX will usually <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">automatically</strong> set the cutting pattern to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Contour"</strong>. You <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">do not need to change it</strong>, nor should you consider changing it to something like "Follow Tool Edge" or similar; that will certainly cause problems, and the program won't run.<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Multi-Depth Machining: Strategy for Deep Holes or High Stock Material</h3><br>In most cases, side milling is a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"single-pass full depth"</strong> operation. That is, it machines from the top face all the way down to your set bottom depth. However, if the workpiece is particularly deep, or if taking such a large Depth of Cut in one go would cause excessive tool wear, then we'll need to use <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">multi-depth machining</strong>.<br><br>*   Find the "Depth Increments" option within "Cutting Parameters."<br>*   Change the default "Single Pass Full Depth" to "Constant."<br>*   Then set the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Depth Per Cut"</strong>. For instance, if you want each pass to take <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">20mm</strong>, then enter <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">20</strong>. This way, if the total depth is 40mm, it will automatically divide it into two layers for machining.<br>*   The benefits of multi-depth machining are more uniform tool loading, improved chip evacuation, higher machining stability, and effectively extending tool life.<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Master Wang's Insights: Siemens NX Templating and Operation Tips</h2><br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第30节课  三轴/side-milling-03.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">The "Templating" Advantage of Side Milling</h3><br>Some of the younger generation might notice that the parameters within "Side Milling" look remarkably similar to, or even identical to, what we've covered for "Planar Milling" or "Profile Milling." Why is that?<br><br>The truth is, many operations in Siemens NX are "packaged" or, you could say, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"templated"</strong> based on underlying modules. This "Side Milling" feature is essentially using the "Planar Milling" function with a preset set of parameters specifically optimized for side cutting. The benefit of this is that it makes our operations <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">more convenient and faster</strong>, eliminating the need to modify a bunch of parameters every time, thus reducing the chances of errors. It solidifies the most common side cutting scenarios for you, greatly boosting programming efficiency.<br><br>So, there's no need for us to get hung up on whether its underlying mechanism is planar milling. Just know what it can do and how to execute it in the fastest and most stable way—that's what matters!<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Naming Conventions and Operational Details</h3><br>When creating operations in Siemens NX, there are a few small points to pay attention to:<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第30节课  三轴/side-milling-04.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Naming Conflict</strong>: If you've already created an operation named "Side Milling" and try to create another one, the system will prompt you that <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">operations with the same name are not allowed</strong>. Don't be foolish in this situation; just add a number or symbol to the end, like "Side Milling 1" or "Side Milling.1". This is how the software logic works, and we have to go with it.<br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Practice Makes Perfect</strong>: These operations form the foundation of your proficiency. After each lesson, make sure to machine a few parts yourself, click around, and input parameters multiple times. Practice reveals the truth; don't just listen to me talk, get your hands dirty!<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Summary: Pitfall Avoidance Guide</h3><br>Master Wang trains apprentices by never getting bogged down in fancy theories, only by teaching practical skills that are useful in real-world scenarios and help you avoid common pitfalls. Let me quickly recap the essence of today's lesson for you:<br><br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Don't Confuse Terminology</strong>: Remember, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Side Milling" is not "Corner Cleanup"</strong>. Its focus is on using the tool's side cutting edge to remove stock incrementally, boosting efficiency.<br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Calculate "Additional Passes" Carefully</strong>: This is a trap! It's crucial to remember: <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Total Passes = Additional Passes + 1</strong>. Miscalculate even one step, and you might not clear all the stock, or worse, leave no allowance for Finishing.<br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Don't Mess with the Cutting Pattern</strong>: In side milling, the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">cutting pattern defaults to "Contour"</strong>. Don't blindly change it; it's already the optimal solution.<br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Cleverly Use "Depth Increments" for Deep Machining</strong>: When machining depth is significant, learn to set the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Depth Per Cut"</strong> for multi-depth machining. This effectively protects the tool, improves machining quality, and boosts efficiency. Don't just think about going full depth in one pass; that'll wear out your tool!<br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Naming Conventions are Fundamental</strong>: Don't get stuck because of duplicate names; learn to add a sequence number or identifier to the name. This is basic software operation common sense.<br>*   <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Real-World Cutting Spark Beats Simulation</strong>: No matter how realistic Siemens NX simulation is, it can't compare to the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">cutting sparks and sounds</strong> from an actual machine tool during machining. A good machinist can judge the quality of a toolpath and whether the Depth of Cut is appropriate just by listening and observing the sparks. Don't just rely on software simulations; go down to the shop floor and observe the actual conditions!<br><br>Alright, that's all for today. Go back, practice more, ponder on these concepts, and make them your own! See you next time!
