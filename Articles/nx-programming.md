<h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Introduction: The Importance of Corner Cleanup – Small Details, Big Impact</h2><br><p><br>Listen up, folks! Last time, we covered roughing side wall treatment and tool compensation – these are fundamental skills. But today we're tackling a tough nut to crack – <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Planar Profile Milling Corner Cleanup</strong>. Don't think Corner Cleanup is just about switching to a smaller tool and milling away. There's a lot more to it. Mess it up, and you're either leaving residual material or causing tool crashes – all wasted effort. In our line of work, you need to be observant and know your stuff. These practical tips, which you won't find in textbooks, Master Wang will break down and explain thoroughly today!<br></p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Residual Material from Roughing: Why Corner Cleanup is Necessary?</h2><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">The 'Side Effects' of Large Tool Roughing</h3><br><p><br>In machining, to improve efficiency, we typically use larger tools for roughing. For example, you might use a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D32 flat end mill</strong> for roughing a part's side walls. This D32 tool can quickly mill away most of the material, no problem. However, issues arise when the part's internal corner radius is smaller than the roughing tool's radius.<br></p>
<br><p><br>For instance, if your part has an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">R10 internal corner radius</strong>. A D32 tool has a radius of R16. Obviously, an R16 tool cannot perfectly enter an R10 corner. It can only follow an R16 path, which means it will inevitably leave <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">a ring of residual material</strong> at the R10 corner. If this residual material isn't cleaned up, subsequent finishing passes will be problematic. The finishing tool will first encounter these roughing remnants, which could, at best, affect dimensional accuracy and surface quality, or at worst, cause immediate tool breakage!<br></p>
<br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Residual Material Traps Invisible to the Naked Eye</h3><br><p><br>Don't just rely on software simulations. When the tool runs on the machine, the cutting sparks and sounds are the most accurate feedback. Sometimes, the screen looks perfectly clean, but in reality, a thin layer of residual material remains. You might not even spot this with your eyes, but it's physically there, waiting to cause problems for your subsequent finishing passes. Therefore, this Corner Cleanup step must not be overlooked!<br></p>

The core feature lies in the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">'Reference Tool'</strong>. Listen up, this is the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">soul</strong> of NX Corner Cleanup!<br></p>
<br><p><br>After selecting the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">'Planar Profile Milling'</strong> operation, go into the tool path parameters, find the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">'Containment'</strong> tab, and within it, a sub-option called <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">'In-Process Workpiece'</strong>. Click on it, and you'll see a crucial checkbox: <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">'Use Reference Tool'</strong>.<br></p>
<br><p><br>This function means: you are telling the current Corner Cleanup tool that the area it needs to machine is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">where the previous roughing tool could not reach</strong>. In other words, the Corner Cleanup tool won't re-mill the entire surface; it will only 'target' the residual material and strike precisely. This significantly saves machining time and protects the tool.<br></p>
<br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Selecting the Correct Reference Tool</h3><br><p><br>The selection of the reference tool is crucial. You must select <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">the previous tool (or any earlier tool) that left residual material</strong>. If your roughing operation used a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D32</strong> flat end mill, then for Corner Cleanup, you should designate this <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D32</strong> tool as your <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">reference tool</strong>.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC29%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-programming-02.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>For example, if we are now using a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D16</strong> tool for Corner Cleanup. NX will automatically calculate the areas that the D32 tool could not access, based on the geometry of your defined D16 tool and the D32 reference tool, and then only allow the D16 tool to machine these specific areas. Pretty clever, right? That's the beauty of intelligent machining!<br></p>

What does this parameter mean? It makes the Corner Cleanup tool path <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">extend slightly beyond the residual material area</strong>, essentially 'going a bit further.'<br></p>
<br><p><br>Why the need to go a bit further? This is to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">prevent tool crashes</strong> and <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">ensure thorough cleaning</strong>. If the Corner Cleanup tool path stops precisely at the edge of the residual material, there's a risk of tiny remnants being left behind, or vibration during tool entry/exit, affecting surface quality. So, Master Wang's experience is that the default value of <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">2mm</strong> is usually reliable, but you can adjust it based on the actual situation. For instance, for precise Corner Cleanup, I might set it to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0.5mm to 1mm</strong> to ensure thorough cleaning without excessive air cutting.<br></p>
<br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">The 'E' vs. 'R' Debate for Reference Tools: Master Wang's Exclusive Secret</h3><br><p><br>In NX, tools typically come in E-type (End Mill, flat bottom) and R-type (Ball Nose, ball-end or corner radius) variations. When setting up reference tools, there's a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">very important practical trick</strong>.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC29%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-programming-03.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>If your roughing tool is an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E32 (i.e., D32 diameter, no corner radius)</strong>, then when defining the reference tool, it's best to use an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E-type tool</strong> for reference as well. Even better, Master Wang typically references a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">slightly larger E-type tool</strong>, such as an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E34</strong>, and then sets the overlap distance to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0</strong>.<br></p>
<br><p><br>Why is this done? Because when NX calculates residual material, it uses the shape of your defined reference tool as the basis. If you reference exactly a D32 tool, even with an overlap distance set, sometimes at the roughing and Corner Cleanup tool path transition, a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">minute 'witness mark'</strong> (a trace of residual material) might still be left. However, by referencing an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E34</strong>, you're essentially telling NX that 'the previous tool' was even larger than D32. This causes the D16 Corner Cleanup tool path to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">extend further outward</strong>, completely sweeping away any tiny bit of residual material that D32 might have left. This ensures thorough cleaning while avoiding unproductive air cutting caused by overlap distance – these are hard-earned insights from years of experience!<br></p>
<br><p><br>Conversely, if you used a D32 flat end mill for roughing but referenced a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D32R0.8</strong> (with an 0.8mm corner radius) tool, then NX would assume the roughing tool had an R0.8 corner. The calculated residual material area would be smaller, potentially leaving remnants in some places, forcing you to add an extra pass – isn't that just wasted time? Therefore, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">matching the tool type and size</strong> is particularly critical here.<br></p>

NX offers options such as <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Climb Milling</strong>, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Conventional Milling</strong>, and <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Mixed Milling</strong>.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC29%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-programming-04.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>Master Wang typically recommends <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Climb Milling</strong> for Corner Cleanup. The advantages of Climb Milling are that the cutting force direction aligns with the feed direction, leading to relatively longer tool life and better machined surface quality, making it especially suitable for Corner Cleanup operations that require a good surface finish. While Mixed Milling can improve efficiency in some situations, for scenarios like Corner Cleanup which demand stable cutting, Climb Milling offers higher reliability.<br></p>

This is key to improving efficiency and tool life.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Precisely select the reference tool</strong>: Ensure your chosen reference tool accurately reflects the shape and size of the tool used in the previous roughing step. If the roughing tool was a flat end mill (E-type), select an E-type for reference.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Master Wang's Exclusive Secret</strong>: If roughing with a D32 flat end mill, for Corner Cleanup, you can reference an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E34</strong> (a slightly larger E-type tool) and set the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">overlap distance to 0</strong>. This thoroughly removes residual material, prevents minute 'witness marks,' and reduces air cutting. If your reference tool is the same size as the actual roughing tool, then the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">overlap distance must not be 0</strong>; a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">2mm</strong> setting is recommended.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">The importance of overlap distance</strong>: It ensures the tool path extends slightly beyond the residual material area, preventing tool crashes, and ensuring thorough Corner Cleanup. This parameter is often overlooked by newcomers.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Use Climb Milling for Corner Cleanup</strong>: For fine machining operations like Corner Cleanup, Climb Milling generally provides better surface quality and tool life.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Think outside the box</strong>: Don't be rigid! Features like 'Reference Tool' and 'Tool Compensation' are interchangeable across many operation modules in NX, for example, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Floor and Wall Milling</strong> can also utilize these techniques. Learning to apply principles broadly is how you master NX and become a true expert!</li><br></ol><br><p><br>Corner Cleanup is an art that you won't master just by clicking a few buttons. It requires a deep understanding and extensive experience with tools, materials, machines, and Siemens NX software. Practice extensively, observe diligently. Don't just listen to Master Wang; get your hands dirty, try things out, watch the cutting sparks, feel the machine vibrations – that's where true skill comes from!<br></p>
