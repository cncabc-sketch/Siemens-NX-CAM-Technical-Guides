<p>Hello everyone, I'm Old Wang, Master Wang. I've been working at the machine shop for fifteen years, and I've seen it all: turning, milling, planing, grinding, EDM. With Siemens NX, it's not just about building models; the real skill is programming toolpaths that are both fast and stable.</p>
<br><br><p>Today, let's talk about <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">entry motion</strong> and <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">enclosed regions</strong> in Siemens NX machining. Don't think it's just a few clicks in the software; there's a lot more to it, and you won't learn these tricks from textbooks.</p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Non-Cutting Moves Overview: Why is Entry Motion So Important?</h2><br><br><p>Listen up: in Siemens NX, when programming toolpaths, besides the actual cutting process, a critical aspect is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">non-cutting moves</strong>. This includes entry motion, retract motion, smoothing, and so on. Don't underestimate these rapid moves; they directly impact your <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">machining efficiency</strong> and <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">tool life</strong>. Incorrect entry motion can lead to minor tool wear, or worse, chipped tools, tool breakage, or even a machine crash!</p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第16节课  三轴/entry-strategies-01.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><p>Entry motion, in particular, is the tool's first contact with the workpiece, determining the initial state of cutting forces on the tool. Especially when encountering enclosed regions, the tool cannot simply enter from the side; it must "drill" into the material. This requires careful consideration of how to "drill" in a stable and efficient manner.</p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Region Type Analysis: Enclosed vs. Open, How Siemens NX Sees It?</h2><br><br><p>First, you need to understand whether the area you're machining is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">enclosed</strong> or <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">open</strong>. Siemens NX programming is much smarter than you might think.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC16%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/entry-strategies-01.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第16节课  三轴/entry-strategies-02.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">What is an Enclosed Region?</h3><br><p>Simply put, it's an area where the tool cannot directly enter from the side. For example, a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">fully enclosed deep pocket, blind hole, internal groove</strong>, etc. The tool must either plunge vertically into the material or descend to the specified depth via helical or ramp entry before cutting can begin.</p>
<br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Master Wang's Insight:</strong> When encountering such areas, the tool is like a diver entering the water; it needs a safe and stable way to descend. Otherwise, plunging straight in will lead to severe <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Depth of Cut (DOC)</strong>, causing problems!</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">What is an Open Region?</h3><br><p>As the name suggests, this is an area where the tool can freely enter from the outside of the workpiece or from the side of an already machined area. For example, the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">outer contour of a part, an open slot, or an internal area that has already been opened up through roughing</strong>.</p>
<br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Master Wang's Insight:</strong> Open regions are much easier; the tool can directly plunge in, or gently "graze" in from the side, eliminating the need for helical entry and resulting in higher efficiency.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Siemens NX's Intelligent Judgment: Don't Blindly Change Parameters!</h3><br><p>I want to emphasize that Siemens NX is very intelligent! After you select a machining region, it will <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">automatically determine</strong> whether it's an enclosed or open region. Accordingly, it will only apply the entry motion parameters you've set for that specific region type.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC16%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/entry-strategies-02.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><ul><br>    <li>If you're machining an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">enclosed region</strong>, then changing "open region entry motion parameters" as much as you like will be <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">useless</strong>! It will only look at the settings under "enclosed region entry motion."</li><br>    <li>The inverse is true: when machining an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">open region</strong>, it will only acknowledge the "open region entry motion" parameters.</li><br></ul><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Master Wang's Reminder:</strong> Don't waste time changing parameters that won't take effect! You might think the software will obey you, but in reality, it has its own "judgment." You need to clearly identify what type of region you've selected, then apply the appropriate settings. The <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">yellow line</strong> in the software simulation is the entry path you really need to pay attention to!</p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第16节课  三轴/entry-strategies-03.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Entry Strategies for Enclosed Regions: Helical is King!</h2><br><br><p>For enclosed regions, the most common and safest entry method is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Helical Entry</strong>. The tool slowly descends in a helical path, gradually engaging the material, which avoids the massive impact of vertical plunging and significantly extends tool life.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Helical Entry Core Parameters</h3><br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第16节课  三轴/entry-strategies-04.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><p>In Siemens NX's "Non-Cutting Moves" settings, find "Enclosed Region Entry Motion," and pay close attention to these parameters:</p>
<br><ul><br>    <li><br>        <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;"><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Diameter</strong>:</strong> This parameter controls the diameter of the helical entry. It's usually defaulted to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">90% of the tool diameter</strong>.<br>        <p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Master Wang's Insight:</strong> Don't arbitrarily reduce this value! If the diameter is too small, the tool's center load becomes excessive, leading to wear and even tool breakage. Especially when machining hard materials like <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">titanium alloys or high-temperature nickel-based alloys</strong>, ensuring sufficient diameter is crucial for tool survival.</p>
<br>    </li><br>    <li><br>        <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;"><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Ramp Angle</strong>:</strong> This is the angle at which the tool descends helically. It's usually defaulted to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">2 degrees</strong>.<br>        <p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Master Wang's Insight:</strong> This angle is the balance point between efficiency and safety. A smaller angle means smoother entry, less force on the tool, but a longer entry time. A larger angle means faster entry, but also greater impact and load on the tool.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC16%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/entry-strategies-03.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br>        <ul><br>            <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Soft materials (e.g., aluminum)</strong>: The angle can be appropriately increased, for example, to 3-5 degrees, to improve efficiency.</li><br>            <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Hard materials (e.g., mold steel, titanium alloys)</strong>: Be conservative, maintain 1-2 degrees, or even smaller, to ensure tool safety.</li><br>            <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Tool characteristics</strong>: Two-flute tools can tolerate larger entry angles than multi-flute tools because the cutting force is distributed among fewer flutes.</li><br>        </ul><br>    </li><br>    <li><br>        <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;"><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Start Height for Ramp</strong>:</strong> This parameter determines the Z-axis height from which the helical entry begins. In Siemens NX, options like "Incremental Depth," "Current Length," or "Top Surface" are common.<br>        <p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Master Wang's Insight:</strong> Generally, choosing <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Incremental Depth"</strong> (or a similar setting relative to the previous cut) is safer, meaning the tool starts its helical path from the bottom of the previous toolpath or a safe height above it. You can also specify an absolute value, such as <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">1mm or 2mm</strong> (approx. 0.04-0.08 inch), allowing the tool to begin helical entry 1-2mm above the current cutting plane.</p>
<br>        <p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Practical Point:</strong> This height should not be set too high, as it will result in too many rapid moves and waste time. Nor should it be set too low, as the tool might crash into the material before even starting the helical path.</p>
<br>    </li><br></ul><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Minimum Safe Distance</h3><br><p>This parameter, during helical entry, controls the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">minimum distance between the helical path and the workpiece wall</strong>. When you set this value, for instance, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0.1mm</strong> (approx. 0.004 inch), the tool's outermost edge will maintain at least 0.1mm clearance from the workpiece wall during helical descent.</p>
<br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Master Wang's Insight:</strong> This is about giving the tool "breathing room"! Especially with new tools, high-precision machining, or when slight machine wear causes accuracy deviations, setting a small safe distance can effectively <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">prevent the tool from scraping the sidewall during helical entry</strong>, protecting the tool and ensuring the side wall's surface finish. However, this value shouldn't be too large, or it will leave <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">stepped unmachined material</strong>, requiring subsequent cleanup, which creates more hassle. Typically, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0.05-0.1mm</strong> (approx. 0.002-0.004 inch) is sufficient.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Minimum Ramp Length</h3><br><p>This is an easily overlooked, yet <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">critically important</strong> parameter for certain tools! It refers to the minimum cutting width that needs to be maintained during helical entry to ensure that the tool's effective cutting edges are fully engaged.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC16%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/entry-strategies-04.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Master Wang's Secret: Tool Type and Ramp Length Percentage</strong></p>
<br><ul><br>    <li><br>        <p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Solid Carbide End Mill</strong>: These tools typically offer <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">full-flute cutting</strong>, with no "blind spot" at the tool tip. Therefore, their helical entry diameter can be relatively small, such as <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">10% to 20% of the tool diameter</strong>, or even smaller.</p>
<br>    </li><br>    <li><br>        <p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Indexable Insert Tool</strong>: Pay attention! Tools like face mills and shell mills are assembled with inserts, and their centers often have a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"blind spot"</strong> – an area without cutting edges. If your helical entry path diameter is too small, causing the tool's central blind spot to contact the workpiece, you're asking for trouble – <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">increased tool wear, unstable cutting, poor surface finish, or even immediate tool breakage!</strong></p>
<br>        <p>For indexable insert tools, the helical diameter corresponding to this "Minimum Ramp Length" parameter typically needs to be set <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">larger</strong>. Generally, it's recommended to set it to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">50% to 70% of the tool diameter</strong> to ensure all inserts effectively engage in cutting and avoid the blind spot. Remember, don't just rely on software simulation; consider the actual tool geometry and cutting principles!</p>
<br>    </li><br></ul><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Summary: Pitfall Avoidance Guide</h3><br><ol><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Clarify Region Type</strong>: Before machining, always clearly determine whether it's an enclosed or open region to avoid setting ineffective parameters. Siemens NX will make its own judgment, but you should have a clear understanding as well.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Fine-Tune Helical Entry Parameters</strong>:<br>        <ul><br>            <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Diameter</strong>: Generally keep the default 90%, unless you have special considerations, such as a small diameter tool machining a deep hole.</li><br>            <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Ramp Angle</strong>: Adjust according to material hardness and tool type. Use a small angle for hard materials, and a slightly larger angle for soft materials. But always remember: <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">safety first</strong>!</li><br>            <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Start Height for Ramp</strong>: Select an appropriate Z-value to avoid excessive rapid moves and prevent collisions.</li><br>        </ul><br>    </li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Balancing "Minimum Safe Distance"</strong>: Don't set it too large, or it will leave unmachined material; don't set it too small, or there's a risk of scraping. 0.05-0.1mm (approx. 0.002-0.004 inch) is the common range.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Minimum Ramp Length" is Key</strong>: For <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">indexable insert tools</strong>, this is paramount! Ensure the helical diameter is large enough to prevent the tool's blind spot from cutting into the workpiece. This is based on experience, not something the software can fully account for on its own.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Optimization Means Savings</strong>: Every parameter adjustment directly impacts your <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">machining time</strong>, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">tool consumption</strong>, and <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">product quality</strong>. Don't be afraid to experiment; adjust, simulate multiple times, and find the optimal process parameters for your needs.</li><br></ol><br><p>Alright, that's all for today. Remember, software is just a tool. A true expert understands these parameters, making the machine work for them, instead of being led by the software!</p>
