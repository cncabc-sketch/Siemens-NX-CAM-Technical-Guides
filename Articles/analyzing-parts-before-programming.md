<br><p>Hello everyone, I'm Master Wang. Starting from this lesson, we'll officially delve into Siemens NX programming. Today, let's talk about how to "see through" a part before programming to avoid detours!</p><br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Step One: Understand Basic Part Dimensions and Raw Material Size</h2><br><p>Listen up! When you get a part, the first thing isn't to rush to click the mouse, but to "measure its three dimensions"! It's like knowing your clothes size; machining is the same.</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Measuring Finished Dimensions and Raw Material Size</h3><br><p>In Siemens NX, we need to use the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Measure Entity"</strong> function. Click it open, measure the part's length, width, and height. For this example, the length is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">270mm</strong>, the width is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">180mm</strong>, and the height is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">40mm</strong>. Keep these finished dimensions in mind. At the same time, you need to know the raw material's size; this determines your roughing stock.</p><br><p>Master Wang's Tip: Don't just rely on the software display. In actual machining, ensure your raw material has sufficient allowance. You don't want to find out you're short on material at the machine, or that the allowance is too large, leading to excessive air cutting time!</p><br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Step Two: Detailed Inspection of Part Geometry (Fillets and Slopes)</h2><br><p>After measuring the overall dimensions, it's time to act like a detective and thoroughly inspect every corner and edge of the part. Especially fillets and slopes, as they directly influence your tool selection and machining strategy.</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Analyzing Fillet Sizes</h3><br><p>We'll use the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Geometric Properties"</strong> function to check fillets. For instance, if your fillet radius is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">R10</strong>, your tool selection needs careful consideration. Using a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D20</strong> (diameter 20mm) end mill to machine this fillet is perfectly fine; it will clear it precisely. Of course, a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D16</strong> or <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D10</strong> tool can also be used, as long as the tool diameter is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">less than or equal to 20mm</strong>. But don't even think about using a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D1</strong> tool; that's just unrealistic. It'll be incredibly inefficient and you'll likely break the tool.</p><br><p>So, the principle of tool selection is: it must be able to reach the desired feature while also considering efficiency and cost. Don't use a cannon to kill a mosquito, nor a sewing needle to chisel a rock!</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Checking Side Wall Slope (Perpendicularity)</h3><br><p>Slope analysis is extremely important! Open the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Draft Analysis"</strong> function and carefully examine the side walls. If all side walls appear <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">green</strong>, it means they are all <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">vertical faces (straight walls)</strong>, without any undercuts or tapers. This simplifies the part, allowing you to machine it directly with a standard end mill, without needing special processes. If you find any areas with incorrect colors, like red, there might be undercuts or sloped surfaces, and you'll need to consider using ball end mills, tapered tools, or 5-axis machining.</p><br><p>Remember: understand the part's "temperament" to prescribe the right treatment, so you don't get flustered at the machine.</p><br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Step Three: Establish a Standardized Program Management Process</h2><br><p>After analyzing the part, we move on to programming. But programming isn't random; it needs a method. Especially for beginners, a standardized program management process is crucial.</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Creating Operations in Sequence</h3><br><p>In Siemens NX, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">right-click on a folder -> Insert -> Operation</strong>. Pay attention here: operations must be created in the actual machining sequence. For example, roughing first, then semi-finishing, and finally finishing pass, from top to bottom, outside to inside. You can't just jump to programming a specific hole because you want to machine it first; that will lead to big problems on the actual machine!</p><br><p>Imagine this: you still have a lot of raw material on top that hasn't been cleared, and suddenly you go to machine a small hole. Isn't that just asking for a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">tool crash</strong>? So, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">roughing before finishing, outside before inside, face milling before hole drilling</strong> – these are fundamental principles. While we can be a bit more flexible during practice, on a real machine, not a single step can be wrong!</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Learning the Practical Use of Each Programming Command</h3><br><p>Our current learning focus is to understand how each programming command is used, such as <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Face Milling</strong>, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Planar Profile</strong>, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Cavity Milling</strong>, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Depth Profile</strong>, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Flow Cut</strong>, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Curve Drive</strong>, and so on. Knowing their individual "personalities" and applicable scenarios will allow you to program with ease.</p><br><p>Remember, these commands are like your toolbox. Understanding the purpose of each tool will make you a true "master operator"!</p><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; margin-top:20px;">Summary: Pitfall Avoidance Guide</h3><br><ul><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Blindly starting is a major taboo!</strong> Always thoroughly analyze part geometry before programming, including dimensions, fillets, and slopes. Don't overlook any detail.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Tool selection isn't guesswork!</strong> Choose tools rationally based on fillet sizes and side wall characteristics, balancing machining efficiency and cost. Avoid using small tools for large tasks or large tools for small holes.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Program sequence is critical!</strong> During actual machining, strictly follow the "roughing before finishing, outside before inside" principle for operation arrangement to prevent tool crashes and ensure safe and efficient production.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Take detailed notes!</strong> Develop a good habit of recording the analysis results and tool selection strategies for each part, building your own machining experience database.</li><br></ul>
