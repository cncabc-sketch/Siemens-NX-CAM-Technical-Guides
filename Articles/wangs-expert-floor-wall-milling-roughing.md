<p><br>    Hello everyone, I'm Master Wang. Today, we're going to discuss the NX Floor-Wall Milling function, especially how to cleverly handle through-holes that have "no bottom face." This is practical experience you won't find in textbooks, so pay close attention—there's a lesson in every detail!<br></p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Preparation is Key: Program Post-processing</h2><br><br><p><br>    For us in manufacturing, once a program is created, the first step is to generate the NC code. Don't underestimate post-processing; there are many intricacies involved.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC21%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-roughing-01.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Efficiency Secret: Batch Post-processing</h3><br><p><br>    In Siemens NX, you can select a single operation and directly click the A04 Post-process button. However, if you have many operations, post-processing them one by one is too slow. Listen up: you can select all operations (or select the folder containing them), then directly click <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Batch Post-process"</strong> in the post-processing menu. This generates NC code for all operations at once, saving time and effort—it's a neat trick for boosting efficiency. As for the file format, whether it's NC or MDF (e.g., for Siemens controllers), that depends on your machine and company standards; just make sure to select the correct one.<br></p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Traditional Solution for "No Bottom Face" Through-Holes: Modeling to Create a Virtual Face</h2><br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第21节课  三轴/wangs-expert-floor-wall-milling-roughing-01.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><p><br>    Alright, back to today's main topic. Floor-Wall Milling, as the name suggests, requires a bottom face. However, in real-world machining, you often encounter through-holes that are just smooth cavities—where's the bottom face for you to select?<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC21%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-roughing-02.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Creating a Bounded Plane: A Virtual Bottom Face</h3><br><p><br>    The most straightforward method is to "trick" the software by creating a bottom face for it. In the Modeling module, find the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Bounded Plane"</strong> function. By selecting the edge curves of the through-hole, you can generate a temporary sheet body, which we'll use as our "bottom face." Once this temporary bottom face is created, your machining operation will have a reference.<br></p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Floor-Wall Milling Operation Settings: Pay Attention to the Filter</h3><br><p><br>    After creating this virtual bottom face, we can proceed to create a Floor-Wall Milling operation as usual. When selecting the machining area, pay attention to one detail: the filter for <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Specify Part"</strong> might default to "Sheet Body." If you're selecting a solid body, it won't be recognized. In this case, you need to change it to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"No Selection"</strong>, then select your entire part for machining. Don't forget this detail, or the software will throw an error.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC21%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-roughing-04.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>    Then, for specifying the bottom face of the cut area, select the Bounded Plane we just created. For the remaining parameters, such as the Depth of Cut (DOC), when roughing, I generally prefer to set it <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">a bit larger (e.g., 1 mm)</strong>. This increases machining efficiency; don't just think about tool life, but also overall cost and lead time.<br></p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">The "Red Face" Warning for Geometry Changes: Don't Mess with References</h2><br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第21节课  三轴/wangs-expert-floor-wall-milling-roughing-02.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><p><br>    Listen up: In NX, if your operation suddenly turns red, it usually means your original geometry or referenced objects have been modified or deleted. For instance, if you add a fillet to the part in Modeling, or delete a sheet body referenced by the operation, the machining operation will immediately show a "red face."<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC21%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/wangs-expert-floor-wall-milling-roughing-01.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>    A "red face" means the operation is invalid and requires re-specifying the geometry or re-generating the toolpath. Therefore, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">once a machining operation is created, try not to modify or delete the original modeling geometry, especially any areas referenced by the operation.</strong> If you absolutely must make changes, be prepared to update the operation accordingly.<br></p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">When a Bottom Face Truly Doesn't Exist: Roughing by Specifying "Walls"</h2><br><br><p><br>    So, what if I don't want to create a Bounded Plane in Modeling, or I simply want to rough directly using "walls"? Of course, there's a way! However, personally, Master Wang doesn't use this method very often.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC21%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/wangs-expert-floor-wall-milling-roughing-02.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Master Wang's Practical Choice: Planar Milling is More Efficient</h3><br><p><br>    When I do machining, I prioritize efficiency and stability. For roughing such through-holes, if there's truly no bottom face to reference, I generally opt for <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Planar Milling"</strong>. It provides more direct toolpaths for planar contours and through-holes, and its parameter settings align better with my workflow. I typically use Floor-Wall Milling for situations where there's a bottom face and side walls need finishing. However, since we're discussing it today, I'll explain clearly how to select these "walls."<br></p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第21节课  三轴/wangs-expert-floor-wall-milling-roughing-03.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Practical Demonstration of "Specify Wall": Appears Similar, but There's a Difference</h3><br><p><br>    When creating a Floor-Wall Milling operation, if you cannot specify a bottom face, you can select <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Specify Wall"</strong> instead. At this point, you'll need to select the inner wall faces of the through-hole. Then, generate the toolpath, and you'll notice it looks identical to the toolpath generated when specifying a bottom face. It also cuts layer by layer according to the defined Depth of Cut (DOC) (e.g., <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">1 mm</strong> per pass for a total depth of <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">10 mm</strong>).<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC21%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/wangs-expert-floor-wall-milling-roughing-03.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;"><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Pitfall: Stock Allowance Setting Trap</strong></h3><br><p><br>    However, there's a crucial pitfall here, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">pay close attention!</strong> When you choose "Specify Wall" for machining, the default <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Part Stock"</strong> is ineffective! Any stock allowance you set there will not be recognized by the operation. Where is the actually effective stock allowance? It's hidden under the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Walls"</strong> option, specifically in <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Wall Stock"</strong>!<br></p>
<br><p><br>    If you use "Specify Wall" for roughing and want to leave stock on the side walls, you must set it in <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Wall Stock."</strong> This differs from our usual habit of setting a unified stock allowance in "Part Stock." Many users stumble here, resulting in the operation finishing the side walls with no stock left—milling straight to the final dimension! That's why I don't use this method often; it's too prone to errors, requiring constant vigilance.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC21%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/wangs-expert-floor-wall-milling-roughing-04.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">The "Z-Depth Offset" Secret for Depth Control</h2><br><br><p><br>    Additionally, among the cutting parameters for Floor-Wall Milling, there's a parameter called <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Z-Depth Offset."</strong> This parameter is particularly useful in certain specific situations.<br></p>
<br><p><br>    Its purpose is to allow the tool to cut a bit more or a bit less in the Z-direction. For example, if you want to machine a hole completely through, but the model's Z-depth is exact, you can input a positive value here, such as <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"1"</strong>, and the tool will cut an extra 1 mm deeper, ensuring the hole breaks through completely. Conversely, inputting a negative value will result in less material being cut. This function is simple and practical, helping you solve many minor depth control issues.<br></p>

I more highly recommend creating a Bounded Plane in Modeling, or directly switching to a "Planar Milling" operation to handle through-holes without a bottom face.<br></p>
<br><p><br>    After discussing Floor-Wall Milling for so long, you'll find that many parameters in NX machining operations are interconnected. For instance, "Cutting Pattern," "Stepover," "Cutting Parameters," and "Non-Cutting Moves," among others. Their names, functions, and locations are largely similar. Therefore, by mastering one operation, you can quickly get the hang of many others—this is the principle of "understanding one, understanding all." In future discussions about other operations, I won't dwell on these repetitive parameters; you can apply what you've learned and understand them by analogy.<br></p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Summary: Pitfall Avoidance Guide</h3><br><ul><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Batch Post-processing:</strong> When you have many operations, make good use of the batch function to generate all NC code at once, boosting efficiency.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Specify Part Filter:</strong> When selecting a part for machining, if it's not recognized, check if the filter is set to "No Selection."</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Protecting Original Geometry:</strong> Once machining operations are created, try not to modify or delete the original modeling geometry referenced by the operations, otherwise, the operations will turn "red" and become invalid.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Specify Wall" Stock Allowance Trap:</strong> When using Floor-Wall Milling and selecting "Walls" for machining, remember that <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Part Stock" is ineffective</strong>!
