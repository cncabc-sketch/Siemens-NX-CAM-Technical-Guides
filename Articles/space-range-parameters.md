<br><p>Hello everyone, I'm Master Wang! Today, we'll pick up where we left off. Last time, we covered all the corner parameters. Logically, I could jump straight to the 'More' option above, but we'll save that for later. Today, let's focus on a very practical and crucial topic: <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Space Range Parameters</strong>.</p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Skipping Redundancy: Bottom Face Thickness vs. Blank Thickness</h2><br><p>Look at the blank settings above, isn't there a 'Thickness' option? For example, 'blank thickness' or 'bottom face thickness'. Actually, these concepts are quite similar, and their meanings are largely consistent. In Siemens NX 1980, many parameters have these kinds of interconnections. So, today we won't dwell too much on these redundancies; let's get straight to more practical matters.</p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Core Concept: Extend Bottom Face To</h2><br><p>Listen up, this 'Extend Bottom Face To' is a key player in 'Space Range'! It determines how far the toolpath can extend when machining the bottom face. We'll start with the most commonly used 'First Pass Extension Amount', and then look at other options.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">First Pass Extension Amount: Controlling the First Depth of Cut</h3><br><p>This parameter is extremely critical, as it controls where your tool begins its first Depth of Cut. What does the default <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">55%</strong> mean? Look at the small diagram, and you'll understand. It indicates that the tool's center point is 55% of the tool radius away from the boundary. If you want the tool's first cut to be exactly on the center line, you need to change this value to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">50%</strong>. This way, the tool's centerline aligns perfectly with the boundary, no more, no less – just right!</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC14%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/space-range-parameters-01.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><ul><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Inward Shift:</strong> If you want the tool to start cutting from a position further inside the workpiece, for instance, to avoid burrs on the boundary during face milling, you can reduce this value. For example, changing it to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">30%</strong> will make the tool 'step' inwards a bit, moving more conservatively. Even more aggressively, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">20%</strong> or even <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">10%</strong> will bring the tool closer to the workpiece interior step by step.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Skimming the Edge:</strong> If set to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0%</strong> (or close to 0, like <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0.01%</strong>), theoretically the tool would follow the boundary tightly. However, in practice, this 0% might not always give you the desired effect, and sometimes the software might not even fully support 0, as it's also linked to other parameters like tool retraction paths. So generally, we don't use such extreme values.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Outward Expansion:</strong> Conversely, if you want the toolpath to extend outwards, just increase the value. For example, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">80%</strong> will make the tool travel further outwards. Remember, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">50%</strong> is center-aligned; increasing the value (60%, 70%, 80%, 90%) expands outwards, while decreasing it (40%, 30%, 20%) retracts inwards.</li><br></ul><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Master Wang's Tip:</strong> In actual machining, especially during <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">face milling</strong>, we often need to control the position of the first pass. For example, to prevent <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">chatter</strong> or chipping at the workpiece edge, we might reduce the first pass extension amount, making the tool engage from a more inward position. This reduces the impact on the material's edge. Changing it to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">30%</strong> or even <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">20%</strong> can result in better surface quality and longer tool life.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Single Toolpath Offset: Fine-tuning for Single Paths</h3><br><p>This 'Single Toolpath Offset', as its name implies, is only effective when your program uses a single toolpath. For example, if you're only making one pass in a narrow slot, you can use this parameter to offset the toolpath slightly upwards or downwards. It literally means to deviate from the centerline and move to one side. However, since most of our current programs are not purely single-pass, this parameter is rarely used. Just knowing it exists is enough; we'll skip the detailed explanation for now.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Tool Motion Start: Not Commonly Used, But Good to Know</h3><br><p>This parameter controls the starting point of the tool in the entire toolpath trajectory. For example, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">100%</strong> means starting from the beginning, while <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">50%</strong> means starting from the halfway point of the toolpath. However, in conventional machining, we usually keep this parameter at <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">100%</strong>, meaning the full path is traversed. It doesn't offer the same clear practical value as 'First Pass Extension Amount'. If you want to experiment, feel free to change it, but typically, we skip it.</p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Practical Application of Space Range: Face Milling and Contour Control</h2><br><p>Next, let's use a face milling example to properly understand the different options for 'Extend Bottom Face To'. This is crucial for improving efficiency in real-world applications!</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC14%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/space-range-parameters-02.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p>We'll create a new <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">face milling</strong> operation and select this bottom face for machining. By default, the toolpath might only follow the selected bottom face area, performing a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">zig-zag</strong> cut. You'll find that the tool might only cut the middle of the workpiece, leaving areas untouched at the edges. This happens when the 'Extend Bottom Face To' parameter is not set correctly.</p>
<br><ul><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">"None":</strong> When you select "None", the tool will strictly machine according to the boundary of the bottom face you've selected. If your workpiece has chamfers or transitions at the edges, the tool won't cross this boundary. This leads to the 'incomplete machining' problem we just discussed.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">"Part Contour":</strong> This is the most commonly used option for face milling! By selecting "Part Contour", the system automatically identifies the maximum outer contour of your chosen <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">part</strong>. Even if you've only selected the middle of the bottom face, the tool will machine the entire surface area based on this maximum contour. This avoids issues with air cutting or incomplete machining. Remember, for face milling, prioritize 'Part Contour'!</li><br></ul><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Master Wang's Reminder:</strong> If you only select the bottom face and set 'Extend Bottom Face To' as 'None', the tool will only follow that specific bottom face. This might leave many unmachined areas, which is critical in mass production, leading to rework and material waste, driving up costs! Therefore, flexible use of 'Part Contour' is very important.</p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-top:5px; margin-top:30px;">Merge Distance: Consolidating Scattered Toolpaths</h2><br><p>The 'Merge Distance' parameter isn't just found in face milling; it's encountered in many other operations as well. Its function is simple: to combine your scattered toolpaths into a continuous path.</p>
<br><p>Look here, if I select three cutting areas, two of the toolpaths might be close enough to automatically merge into one. But if the other two areas are further apart, for example, they have a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">100mm</strong> gap between them, they will run independently and won't merge.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC14%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/space-range-parameters-03.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p>In this case, if you want them to merge, you need to input a value greater than <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">100mm</strong> into 'Merge Distance', such as <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">120mm</strong>. This way, the system will treat these two previously independent toolpaths as a single entity. The tool will not retract when moving between them but will travel continuously, significantly reducing <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">air cutting</strong> time and improving efficiency.</p>
<br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Master Wang's Experience:</strong> Using merge distance effectively can significantly reduce the tool's idle travel, especially when machining parts with multiple dispersed features. The effect is particularly pronounced. Conversely, if the merge distance is set too small, the tool will frequently retract and engage, wasting time and increasing wear. Therefore, you must adjust it flexibly based on the actual spacing of the part's features.</p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Bounding Box of Cut Area: Similar to Part Contour</h2><br><p>The 'Bounding Box of Cut Area' actually yields the same results as 'Part Contour' in many situations. When you're face milling a workpiece, selecting 'Bounding Box of Cut Area' will also make the toolpath cover the entire outer contour of the workpiece. It's also a very practical option; generally, you can consider it equivalent to 'Part Contour'. As long as it cleans the face and meets the requirements, use whichever is more convenient.</p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Final Defense: Check Tool and Holder for Collision</h2><br><p>Finally, let's talk about a life-saving parameter: 'Check Tool and Holder for Collision'. This is extremely important, as it directly relates to the safety of your tool, fixture, and workpiece!</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC14%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/space-range-parameters-04.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p>Let's designate a face of a part as the machining area and generate the toolpath without initially considering the tool holder. Next, we need to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">insert a tool holder</strong>. In the program settings, find the 'Set Holder' option. Here, you have many standard tool holders to choose from. For example, let's select a BT40 tool holder with a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">50mm diameter</strong>. After confirming its addition, you'll notice that while the tool holder is present, the actual protrusion length of the tool might be very long, which carries a huge risk of collision!</p>
<br><p>This 'Check Tool and Holder for Collision' option is precisely for alerting you. When checked, NX will help you inspect for interference between the tool, tool holder, fixture, and workpiece. If a collision is detected, it will issue a warning, or even prevent you from generating the toolpath, preventing you from making a rookie mistake. So, Master Wang, I emphasize this repeatedly: always pay attention to this option. It's better to check it an extra time than to risk a machine 'crash'!</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Summary: Pitfall Avoidance Guide</h3><br><ol><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">First Pass Extension Amount:</strong> Adjust flexibly during face milling to retract inwards, reducing edge impact and improving surface quality and tool life.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Extend Bottom Face To:</strong> For face milling, always select <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Part Contour</strong> to ensure the entire machining area is cleaned, avoiding omissions.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Merge Distance:</strong> Adjust based on actual workpiece feature spacing. Proper setting can significantly reduce <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">air cutting</strong> and improve machining efficiency.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Collision Check:</strong> <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Always enable it!</strong> This is the last line of defense against machine damage, scrapped tools, and scrapped workpieces. Don't be lazy; safety first!</li><br></ol><br><p>These are experiences I, Master Wang, have accumulated over years of practical work. You might not find them in textbooks, but they are lessons learned through hard-won experience. I hope you can grasp them well and apply them flexibly!</p>
