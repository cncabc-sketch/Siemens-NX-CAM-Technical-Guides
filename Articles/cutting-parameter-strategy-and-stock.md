<p>Hello everyone, I'm Master Wang. Let's pick up where we left off. Once we cover this section today, we'll have basically wrapped up this page of work.</p>
<h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Cutting Strategy: More Than Just Direction</h2><p>Let's open up <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Cutting Parameters</strong>. There are quite a few commands in here, so we need to break them down one by one. First, let's look at the 'Strategy' section.</p>
<h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Cutting Direction: Climb vs. Conventional Milling, Different Jobs</h3><p>Initially, you'll see a cutting direction, mainly referring to the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Cutting Angle</strong>. When it's moving in the negative direction, this cutting angle appears. It's actually quite simple: it's either climb milling (順銑) or conventional milling (逆銑).</p>
<p>Typically, we mostly choose climb milling. We rarely opt for conventional milling. However, in special working conditions, conventional milling does have its place. Just remember these two methods; climb milling is generally sufficient.</p>
<h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Automatic Cutting Angle: The Software's 'Cleverness'</h3><p>Have you ever noticed that at the beginning of a program, the tool always starts cutting from a specific direction, then follows a certain path? For instance, why does it always start cutting from this direction, and not the opposite? This is the result of <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">automatic control of the cutting angle</strong>.</p>
<p>Click it, and you'll see a bunch of options like 'Specify', 'Longest Edge', 'Fixed Vector', 'Receive Vector'. Don't panic, we'll start with the most commonly used ones.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC12%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/cutting-parameter-strategy-and-stock-01.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<p>For example, choose <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Fixed Vector (Specify Vector)</strong>. Click it, and you'll see four directional arrows on the part. Click on any directional arrow, say this one, then 'Specify', and generate the toolpath. You'll notice:</p>
<ul><li>If you select a vertical arrow, the tool will perform <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">vertical machining</strong>.</li><li>If you select a horizontal arrow, the tool will perform <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">horizontal machining</strong>.</li></ul><p>In short, this command is used to change the machining direction, whether it's milling horizontally or vertically, you decide. If you deselect the specified vector, it will revert to automatic determination.</p>
<h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Specify Angle: Fine Control for Multi-Axis Machining</h3><p>Let's look at 'Angle' within 'Specify'. When the angle is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0 degrees</strong>, the toolpath is horizontal. If we change the angle to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">90 degrees</strong>, and look at the arrow, it's clearly pointing upwards, and the tool will machine vertically.</p>
<p>This function simply allows you to change the tool's machining direction. You can also try 45 degrees, which can also machine, but in actual work, we <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">rarely use such diagonal machining methods</strong>; most of the time, it's either horizontal or vertical.</p>
<p>So, the meaning of 'Cutting Angle' is to let you control the tool's path. Those parameters we didn't cover are generally less used in face milling, and in most cases, automatic mode is sufficient.</p>
<h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Add Finishing Pass: A 'Redundant' Feature for Face Milling</h3><p>The 'Add Finishing Pass' option below is generally not very useful for face milling. We can ignore it for now.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC12%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/cutting-parameter-strategy-and-stock-02.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Allow Undercut: A 'Sharp Tool' for Deep Cavities</h3><p>Here's an important one! As soon as you turn on 'Allow Undercut', you'll see the effect. Look at this small icon: the first pass is fine, but what about the second?</p>
<p>Did you notice that it has <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">overcut</strong>, milling away the entire side wall? This is the function of 'Allow Undercut'; it enables the tool to machine into internal corners of a part, even cutting into areas smaller than the tool's diameter.</p>
<p>If you don't allow undercut, it will only follow the largest outer contour, unable to reach deeper or narrower areas. Of course, if you're using a special tool like a T-slot cutter, allowing undercut for machining side walls is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>However, typically, to avoid unnecessary overcutting, we <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">do not enable 'Allow Undercut'</strong> unless you have specific machining requirements, such as machining undercuts or reverse angle slots.</p>
<h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Cutting Mode and Toolpath Direction: Choosing Your Strategy</h3><p>When we change the 'Strategy' to 'Follow Part', you'll notice the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Cutting Angle option disappears</strong>. Why? Because it doesn't involve whether you're machining horizontally or vertically, so naturally, this option isn't there; only 'Climb' and 'Conventional' directions remain.</p>
<p>This teaches us a principle: the 'Strategy' <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">is determined by the 'Cutting Mode' we select</strong>. For example, if we change to 'Follow Periphery' and generate the toolpath again, you'll find an additional option: 'Inward' or 'Outward'.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC12%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/cutting-parameter-strategy-and-stock-03.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<ul><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Inward</strong>: The tool machines from outside to inside, gradually moving inwards.</li><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Outward</strong>: The tool machines from inside to outside, clearly moving diagonally outwards.</li></ul><p>Therefore, when you choose 'Follow Periphery', you can flexibly select 'Inward' or 'Outward' toolpath directions.</p>
<h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Option B: The Secret Weapon for Corner Cleanup</h3><p>In 'Follow Periphery' mode, an additional <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Option B</strong> will appear. What does this B mean? Typically, if you check it, you'll find that the toolpath includes some 'corner cleanup toolpaths'.</p>
<p>Especially when machining certain corners, if your <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Corner Cleanup (Option B) is not enabled</strong>, you might find that some areas are not machined. In this case, enabling it can resolve the issue.</p>
<p>However, if your machining is simply basic face milling and doesn't require corner cleanup, there's no need to enable Option B.</p>
<h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Stock Settings: Key to Accuracy and Efficiency</h2><p>Now that we've covered strategy, let's move on to 'Stock'. This is crucial for part accuracy and machining efficiency!</p>
<p>There's 'Part Stock', 'B Stock', 'Floor Stock', 'Blank Stock', 'Touch Point Stock', 'Inner Tolerance', 'Outer Tolerance', and so on. Let's go through them one by one.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC12%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/cutting-parameter-strategy-and-stock-04.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Part Stock: How Much to Leave on Side Walls?</h3><p>'Part Stock' is simply how much stock we leave on the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">side walls of the specified part</strong>. Look at this image, the blue side wall. If we change the Part Stock to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0.2mm</strong>, it means we've left 0.2mm of stock on the side wall.</p>
<p>This is crucial during roughing to leave some material for the finishing pass, preventing insufficient accuracy or excessive tool wear from trying to finish in one go.</p>
<h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">B Stock: Dedicated Stock for Special Features</h3><p>'B Stock' refers to the stock left for the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">specified B entity</strong>. Since we haven't selected a B entity yet, this B Stock is currently unused and remains 0. We typically don't use B entities for machining, so we can skip this for now.</p>
<h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Floor Stock: How Much to Leave on the Bottom?</h3><p>The stock for the 'Specify Final Floor', this one is quite easy to understand. For instance, set it to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0.2mm</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's replay the toolpath and then measure. See, the distance between the machined surface and our specified floor is clearly 0.2mm. This is the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Floor Stock</strong>.</p>
<p>In practical work, you don't need to measure every time. Once you've set it correctly and you see that stock is clearly left, then it's accurate. This relates to our <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Percentage of Tool parameters</strong>; if the percentage is not set reasonably, the toolpath will appear very dense.</p>
<h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Summary: Strategy and Stock are Interconnected</h3><p>We've pretty much covered the 'Strategy' and 'Stock' pages in the cutting parameters. The remaining commands, like 'Connect Mold Toolpath', are less used in face milling, so we can skip them for now.</p>
<p>Remember one thing: <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">all these strategy and stock settings must be flexibly adjusted according to your actual workpiece, material, and machining requirements</strong>. There are no one-size-fits-all parameters, only the most suitable configuration for the current task.</p>
<h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Summary: Pitfall Guide</h3><ul><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Cutting Direction</strong>: Mostly climb milling, conventional milling for special cases, but be cautious to avoid chatter.</li><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Cutting Angle</strong>: Adjust toolpath direction based on whether the machining surface is horizontal or vertical, to improve efficiency.</li><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Allow Undercut</strong>: Only enable when machining deep cavities or undercuts; otherwise, use sparingly to prevent overcutting.</li><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Strategy and Cutting Mode</strong>: Strategy options change with the cutting mode; understand their interrelationship.</li><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Option B (Corner Cleanup)</strong>: Only enable when corner cleanup is needed, to avoid unnecessary calculations and toolpaths.</li><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Part/Floor Stock</strong>: Set precisely according to roughing and finishing requirements to ensure smooth subsequent operations and avoid undercutting or overcutting.</li><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Coordinate System</strong>: <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">MCS (Machine Coordinate System)</strong> is the datum; <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">WCS (Work Coordinate System)</strong> can be placed anywhere without affecting machining.</li><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Parameter Fine-tuning</strong>: In actual machining, parameters may need fine-tuning based on machine status, tool wear, etc. Don't just rely on software simulation; watch the cutting sparks and observe the actual results!</li></ul></p>
