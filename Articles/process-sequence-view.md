## 📖 English Tutorial

<h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Introduction: 3-Axis Programming and Environment Switching</h2><br><p>Hello everyone, I'm Master Wang. Starting today, I'll be systematically covering 3-axis programming, from basic 2D toolpaths to drilling, and then on to 3D machining. This is a complete programming workflow, and we'll go step-by-step, from top to bottom, to create a full program and deeply understand what each command is used for.</p><br><p>If you want to review modeling first, you can check out my previous modeling courses. Those courses explain what commands like sketching and extruding do – these are fundamental, and you all need to know them.</p><br><p>Now we're mainly focusing on programming. For programming, we usually go to the <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Manufacturing</strong> page. So, just click "Manufacturing" to enter.</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Listen up, the prerequisite is that you must insert my programming template!</strong> I already have a template loaded. When we click to enter the manufacturing module, we don't need to worry about the default options at the top; the third position is the default. For this, we can also default to the DB template. Just click <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">OK</strong>. This is the first step, entering manufacturing.</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">The Importance of Programming Templates</h3><br><p>At this point, our interface will display some items. The prerequisite is that you must have inserted this programming template. How do you insert it? Look for my "Master Wang Programming Template" link; there's a video that details where to place the template and how to use it, and even <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">how to create your own templates</strong>. That video is straightforward and easy to understand. If you're unsure, watch it a couple of times.</p><br><p>In this course, we won't go into detail about templates; we'll focus on programming itself.</p><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Manufacturing Interface Overview and View Switching</h2><br><p>Looking at the manufacturing page, we have the top, left, bottom, and right sections. In fact, these are all small commands. Let's look at the left side; aren't these quite familiar? They are actually similar to what we covered in the modeling section.</p><br><p>Basically, sometimes we will <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">switch back</strong> to modeling. Just click this position to switch. Click manufacturing again, and it switches back. Click modeling again.</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Listen up, this is where mistakes often happen!</strong></p><br><p>Look at the left side: when we're in manufacturing, doesn't it look quite similar? However, sometimes, the items in manufacturing are not present in modeling. Manufacturing commands, for example, like creating a geometric body or creating a tool, cannot exist in modeling. Similarly, in modeling, you have commands for creating blocks or cylinders, but these won't be found in the manufacturing module.</p><br><p>So, when you can't find a command, it's worth switching to the modeling environment to look for it, especially the bottom panel. The bottom panel in modeling has many more options, but in manufacturing, there are fewer, only up to this point. Just these few.</p><br><p>Therefore, you all can examine it yourselves, especially this particular location, the command area. You can practice switching back and forth to familiarize yourselves with which commands are available where. Once you get used to it, you'll be fine. Getting accustomed to these commands is key.</p><br><p>Of course, there are some commands in manufacturing that are not in modeling, and we'll definitely discuss them. Since this is our first lesson today, we don't need to go into too much detail. We just need to get a basic understanding of these few commands for now.</p><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Key View: Operation Navigator</h2><br><p>For the first step, when we're in manufacturing, this area defaults to displaying the <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Part Navigator</strong>. We definitely don't need the Part Navigator; we need to switch to the <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Operation Navigator</strong>. Because in manufacturing, what we generally use for programming is the Operation Navigator. You can switch it yourself: this is the Part Navigator, and this is the Operation Navigator. There are constraints and assemblies. So, in manufacturing, we basically always use the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Operation Navigator</strong>.</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">The Secrets of the Process Sequence View</h3><br><p>Alright, once you've opened it, do you see? It has this page.</p><br><p>Regarding the top section, I can't go through everything one by one right now. We'll introduce these functions gradually as we go through the programming steps in upcoming lessons. If I were to explain how each one works right now, I believe many of you might not fully grasp it. We need to introduce it bit by bit. However, when we're just starting, in the early stages, it's crucial to know how these few are used.</p><br><p>Also, you need to know how to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">create a Work Coordinate System (WCS)</strong>. That's the G54 WCS. For a machining center, whether we're datum setting on one side or using four-sided datum setting, you definitely need to know this.</p><br><p>So, in our first lesson today, we're mainly talking about these four, these few. This one, and this one, this one, this one – what are they generally used for?</p><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Basic Programming Operations and Program Sequence</h2><br><p>For some basic skills, like right-clicking, left-clicking, selecting, rotating, moving, and so on, you can refer to the initial lessons in the modeling section to get familiar with them. If you're just starting and only want to learn 3-axis programming, then I recommend that you at least have some familiarity with UG. You should at least know how to rotate your model, or how to select linked components, or how to deselect components, or how to select just one specific location, like a single face. For these things, I suggest watching our modeling course, especially the first few lessons. You don't need to watch every single part if you only want to program; it's not necessary to master everything.</p><br><p>But at least you should be familiar with these basic <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">operations</strong>. For example, if you click here, what happens? Or if you click here, what does it do? You must know these things. I won't go into detail here. We will mainly focus on programming commands.</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Understanding the Program Order View</h3><br><p>First step, let's take a quick look at this panel. When the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Program Order View</strong> is highlighted, this area looks like this. I'll drag it over a bit; it's quite long. See? Very, very long.</p><br><p>This area has a <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Tool Path</strong>, which is actually a folder. You can click it, right-click, and select <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Insert Operation</strong>. This is a normal procedure for us: insert operation. For 3-axis, there are all these commands here. All the commands we need to cover in the future are all in here for programming. For 3-axis, we currently only have 3-axis, so it's 3-axis. This is 5-axis; if you're doing 5-axis, watch the 5-axis course. The 5-axis course is almost finished recording. You can just watch the 5-axis course. Of course, if you learn 5-axis, then all these small operations will definitely already be familiar to you. Because if you learn 5-axis, most of the basic 3-axis operations will be covered. So we'll just look at 3-axis.</p><br><p>Alright, for example, I'll just click this command, then OK. I'll just click OK directly. Take a look. I won't talk about other things for now.</p><br><p>To put it simply, this is a program we've created. But it's not actually created yet. We can look at this position. <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Tool Path</strong>, it shows <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Tool</strong>. I haven't selected a tool yet, but you see, the tool number, that means <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">T0</strong>. I'll briefly explain this; it will definitely be covered in more detail later. For now, we'll just give a general overview of this command.</p><br><p>The tool number, which is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">T0</strong>, and then the <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">time</strong>, meaning how long this program will take. Alright, let's just — oh, I clicked the wrong small number. Let's cancel it. We'll go through it one by one. Typically, when inserting, we need to insert A. This refers to A-sequence, B-sequence, C-sequence, D-sequence, E-sequence. These tool paths.</p><br><p>Of course, there was also F, but I think I deleted it. I feel these five are sufficient, so I won't use F. That is, A, B, C, D, E. These tool paths. When we click the small triangle, the small cross, next to A, it further divides into many: <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">A01</strong> all the way to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">A20</strong>. I don't know if everyone is familiar with what this means.</p><br><p>When you're programming in <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">A01</strong>, let's just, I'll randomly select one. OK. Alright, this program is numbered A01. Then in <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">A02</strong>, for example, we insert another operation and create another program, that would be A02. When we post-process, this program will be A01. When we need to run it, we'll run A01 first, then A02. This is how the operations are arranged step-by-step, from A01 all the way to, say, A20. It's about machining these programs sequentially. This is what we'll be programming in the <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Program Order View</strong>.</p><br><p>These are just folders, just the names of the folders. You all should have some understanding of this. Alright, I won't go into excessive detail. Let's take another look, mainly focusing on this area.</p><br><p>First, insert an operation, select the DB sequence. For example, I'll just quickly create a simple program, a very simple program. Click, select this face, select tool. This doesn't matter; you don't need to follow me exactly. We just need to understand what this means for now.</p><br><p>Alright, the program is now generated. We can click the play button to see. Okay, the program is complete. Look at this area: <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Tool Change</strong>, this is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">T10</strong>, indicating we are currently using tool number 10, right here. How exactly is this position found? I'll drag it back a little further.</p><br><p>Okay, some of your setups might be different from mine. Right-click, then Columns.</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Summary: Pitfall Guide</h3><br><ul><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Environment Switching is Fundamental</strong>: You must be proficient in switching between the modeling and manufacturing modules and understand the unique functions of each. If you can't find a command, first check which module you are in.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Operation Navigator is Key</strong>: In the UG NX manufacturing module, you must use the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Operation Navigator</strong> for programming, not the Part Navigator. This is crucial for organizing and managing all machining operations.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Understand the Logic of the Program Order View</strong>: Sequences like A01, A02, etc., represent the execution order of programs. Plan your operation sequence logically to ensure the machining process meets actual production requirements.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Utilize Programming Templates Effectively</strong>: Using pre-set programming templates can significantly improve efficiency and standardization, reducing repetitive work. If you don't have one, make sure to learn how to create or import one.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Basic Operations are a Prerequisite</strong>: Don't underestimate the basics. If you are not proficient with fundamental UG NX modeling operations (selection, rotation, movement, etc.), it will directly impact your programming efficiency and accuracy. Master these basic skills first.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Pay Attention to Tool Numbers (T-numbers)</strong>: In the Process Sequence View, each tool has a corresponding T-number. This is a critical reference for the machine tool to identify and automatically change tools, so you must understand its meaning.</li><br></ul>

## 📖 中文实战教程

> 课题：UG NX 1980 加工程序顺序视图讲解

<h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">开篇：三轴编程入门与环境切换</h2><br><p>大家好，我是王工。从今天开始，我会给大家系统地讲一下三轴编程，也就是从最开始的一些二维的刀路，然后到钻孔，再到三维加工。这是一整套的编程逻辑，我们会从上往下，一步步地把整个程序做出来，并且深入了解这些命令究竟是干什么用的。</p><br><p>如果你想先看建模这块，可以去看我之前的建模课程。建模课程里讲了那些命令都是做什么的，比如草图、拉伸之类的，这些都是基础，大伙儿得知道。</p><br><p>我们现在主要讲的是编程。编程的话，我们一般都是到这个<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">加工</strong>页面。所以，点一下“加工”就进去了。</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">听好了，前提是你肯定要插入我的这个编程模板！</strong>我这里面已经有模板了。当我们点击进入加工模块的时候，上面这些默认选项我们不用管，默认是第三个位置。这个我们也默认DB这个模板就可以了。直接点<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">确定</strong>，这是第一步，到加工里面。</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">编程模板的重要性</h3><br><p>这个时候，我们这个页面就会弹出一些东西。前提是，你肯定要把这个编程模板给它插入进来。怎么去插入？去找一下我那个“王工编程模板”的链接，里面会有一个视频详细讲解模板的放置位置和使用方法，甚至是<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">怎么自己做模板</strong>。那个视频很简单，很好理解。如果你不会，可以多看两遍。</p><br><p>在这个课程里，我们就不再赘述模板了，主要讲编程。</p><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">加工界面概览与视图切换</h2><br><p>加工页面，我们可以看一下，上边、左边、下边和右边。其实这些都是一些小命令。我们看一下左边，左边的这些是不是很熟悉？跟我们建模里面讲过的其实是一样的。</p><br><p>基本上，有时候我们会在<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">切换回</strong>建模。点一下这个位置就可以切换了。再点一下加工，又切换回来了。再点一下建模。</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">听好了，这地方容易犯错！</strong></p><br><p>看一下左边，我们到加工，是不是很像？但是，有的时啊，这个加工里面的东西，建模里面是没有的。加工里面的命令，打个比方，比如创建几何体、创建刀具，在建模里面是不可能有的。然后到建模里面，有一些像创建块啊、圆柱啊，当我们到这个加工里面，也是不可能有的。</p><br><p>所以说，当你找不到那个命令的时候，你不妨切换到建模里面去找一下，特别是下边。下边多了很多，但到加工里面，就没那么多，一共才到这个位置。一共才这些。</p><br><p>所以说，大家可以自己看一下，特别是这个位置，就是这个命令的这个位置，可以自己去练习一下，来回切换切换。然后熟悉一下这些命令究竟是哪边有，哪边没有。当习惯了，那就可以了。习惯了这些命令，就可以了。</p><br><p>当然，到加工里面有一些命令是建模里面没有的，我们肯定是会说一下。当然我们今天第一节课，不用说的太细，太细了。我们只要把这几个命令稍微地了解一下就可以了。</p><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">关键视图：工序导航器 (Operation Navigator)</h2><br><p>第一步，我们这个是到加工里面，它这个位置显示的是<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">部件导航器</strong>。我们肯定是不需要部件导航器，我们要切换成<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">工序导航器</strong>。因为在加工里面，我们一般用的就是工序导航器，我们要编程所使用的。可以自己切换一下，这是部件导航器，这是工序导航器。这有约束、有装配。所以说，我们在加工里面，基本上都是用到这个<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">工序导航器</strong>。</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">加工程序顺序视图的奥秘</h3><br><p>好，点开了之后，看到了吗？它有这一页。</p><br><p>上边的话，我先不能一一说，这个不能一一说。我们只能说，在编程的时候，在接下来的课程当中，会慢慢地往里面去带入，带入这些都是怎么使用的。因为现在我如果说这个怎么使用，我相信大家可能也不是很了解。我们要一点一点往里面去带。但是，我们刚学习的时候，前期的这个情况，一定要知道这几个是怎么使用的。</p><br><p>还有我们这个<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">创建坐标系</strong>是怎么创建的。就是G54坐标系，我们也要知道。加工中心嘛，我们是要单边还是四面分中之类的，肯定是要知道的。</p><br><p>所以说，我们今天第一节课主要说的就是我们这四个，这几个。这个，还有这个，这个，这个，这几个。我们一般究竟是做些什么用的。</p><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">编程基础操作与程序顺序</h2><br><p>一些小的基础，像什么右键、左键、选择、旋转、移动这些，我们在建模里面，大家可以看一下建模里面的前几节课去了解一下。如果你刚学就只想学这个三轴编程的话，那我建议你，至少这个UG你至少要熟悉一点。你至少要知道你这个怎么旋转啊，或者是怎么能够给它链接选动啊，或者是怎么把链接取消啊，或者是只选择这一个位置，比如只选择一个面，怎么选到，这些，我建议看一下我们建模的那个课程。可以去稍微地看一下，特别是前几节课。不用看的那么就是，如果你只想编程的话，就是不用看的完完全全全部看会。</p><br><p>至少这些基本的<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">操作</strong>啊，你是会用的。比如你点一下这个位置，一点，它就会出现什么，或者是点一下这个位置，它会是干嘛了。你这些一定要知道，就可以了。这个我就不细讲了。我们还是主要是去讲这个编程的，一些命令。</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">理解程序顺序视图 (Program Order View)</h3><br><p>第一步，我们可以稍微看一下这个页面。当这个<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">程序顺序视图</strong>高亮的时候，这个位置是长这个样。我稍微往这边拉一下，它有很长。看到了吗？很长很长。</p><br><p>这个位置有个<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">刀轨</strong>，其实这是一个文件夹。你可以点击它，右键，<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">插入工序</strong>。这是我们正常的一个操作，插入工序。三轴，这里面就有这么多命令。这接下来我们需要去讲的这些命令，所有的都在这里面，就是去编编编。三轴的我们现在就是只有三轴，所以说是三轴。这是五轴，五轴的话看五轴的课程。五轴的课程已经录制得差不多了，我们直接看五轴课程就可以了。当然，如果学五轴，学五轴的话，那这些小的操作的话，肯定就都已经会了。因为学五轴的话，我们三轴的一些基本的一些操作，基本上都是可以了。我们直接看三轴。</p><br><p>好，比如随便点一个这个命令，确定。直接我就确定了。看一下。我先不说其他的了。</p><br><p>这个说白了就是我们编了一个程序。但是现在还没编呢。我们可以看一下这个位置。<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">刀轨</strong>，有显示<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">刀具</strong>。我没选刀，你们看，这个刀具号，这个就是<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">T0</strong>那个意思。我大概讲一下，这个可能后来肯定会细致地说一下。现在我们只能说大概地讲一下这个命令。</p><br><p>刀具号，也就是<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">T0</strong>，然后<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">时间</strong>，也就是这个程序多长时间。好，不妨我们就是，我点错了，不能点这个小序号，我们给它取消，取消。一点一点来说。我们重新，一般插入的话，我们需要插入A。这是A序、B序、C序、D序、E序。这些工具。</p><br><p>当然还有一个F，F好像被我删除了。我觉得这五个已经够了，所以说F我就不用了。也就是A、B、C、D、E。这几个刀具。我们当把A的这个小三角，小十字，给它点开的时候，又分了很多：<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">A01</strong>一直到<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">A20</strong>。这个大家，我不知道大家熟不熟悉这个意思。</p><br><p>当你再<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">A01</strong>里面编程序的时候，我们先，我先随便选一个。确定。好，这个程序编号了就是A01。然后你在<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">A02</strong>里面，比如我们再插入工序，再编一个程序，那这个就是A02。我们到时候后处理的时候，就这个程序它就是A01。我们到时候要跑的，先跑A01，再跑A02，就是这个工序，一步一步的往下排，从A01一直，比如说一直排到A20。就是依次去加工这个程序。这个就是我们要在<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">程序顺序视图</strong>里面去编的。</p><br><p>这些就是文件夹，就是文件夹那个名字。这些大家应该是所有了解。好，就不细致的讲了。我们再来看一下，主要是讲一下这个位置。</p><br><p>首先，插入工序，选择DB序。比如我简简单单地编一个程序，特别简单的编一个程序。点击，选择这个面，选择刀具。这个无所谓，大家也不用跟我学。我们先，把这个知道这是什么意思就行。</p><br><p>好，首先这个程序就出来了。我们可以点这个播放，看一下。好，这程序已经编完了。看一下这个位置，<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">换刀</strong>，这个就是<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">T10</strong>，说明我们现在是第十把刀，这个位置啊。当然这个位置是究竟是怎么找出来的呢？我再往后边拉一点点。</p><br><p>好，有的呢，你们的可能不是跟我这个不一样。我们右键，列。</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">总结：避坑指南</h3><br><ul><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">环境切换是基础</strong>：务必熟练掌握在建模与加工模块之间切换，并理解各模块独有的功能。找不到命令时，先检查当前所在模块。</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">工序导航器是核心</strong>：在UG NX的加工模块中，编程时必须使用<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">工序导航器 (Operation Navigator)</strong>，而不是部件导航器。这是组织和管理所有加工操作的关键。</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">理解程序顺序视图的逻辑</strong>：A01、A02等序列代表程序的执行顺序。合理规划你的工序排序，确保加工流程符合实际工艺要求。</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">编程模板要用好</strong>：使用预设的编程模板能大幅提高效率和规范性，减少重复劳动。如果你没有，请务必学习如何创建或导入。</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">基本操作是前提</strong>：不要眼高手低，如果UG NX的基础建模操作（选择、旋转、移动等）不熟练，会直接影响你的编程效率和准确性。先补齐这些基本功。</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">关注刀具号 (T号)</strong>：在加工程序顺序视图中，每一把刀具都有对应的T号。这是机床识别和自动换刀的重要依据，必须清楚其含义。</li><br></ul>
