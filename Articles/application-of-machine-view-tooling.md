## 📖 English Tutorial

<br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Introduction: Tooling Basics Before Programming</h2><br><p>Hello everyone, I'm Master Wang. In our last lesson, we discussed the Program Order View. We've already covered those topics, like this specific area here. You don't need to memorize every single detail of what each function does, but it's crucial to understand their literal meaning.</p><br><p>As we delve into programming, you'll gradually become more familiar with all these various elements, little by little. Eventually, you won't even need to think about their exact purpose. So, for now, a general understanding is sufficient.</p><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Core Function: Machine View and Tool Visualization</h2><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Enabling and Understanding Machine View</h3><br><p>This was mentioned before. Let's look at the option below it, called <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Machine View</strong>. We can simply click on it.</p><br><p>The main point is that you can see what it means: it <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">displays the Machine View in the Operation Navigator</strong>. In essence, it allows you to show the machine and observe how it moves and how the tool operates to machine your part. You can see all the toolpaths and movements.</p><br><p>However, for our initial learning phase, we haven't even created a program yet, so this feature isn't immediately useful. If you want to use it, you would go to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Edit</strong>, then 'Load Machine from Library' to find many different machines. But we won't go into that for now.</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Understanding the Tool List: Templates and Customization</h3><br><p>What we need to discuss are the items below. You can scroll down; these can be dragged down further. What do all these items mean at the bottom? I believe many of you might already have some understanding and will grasp it quickly.</p><br><p>This entire section contains all of our <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">tools</strong>. Where are our tools located? They are all placed here on the side.</p><br><p>Why are these tools here? It's because of the template I created at the very beginning, remember? That template.</p><br><p>If you wish to add or delete these tools yourself, you need to go into that template to perform the addition or deletion.</p><br><p>How do you do it? Please refer to my 'Master Wang's Template' tutorial; there's a 'Programming Template' section within it. Go there to see how it's created.</p><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">In-Depth Analysis of Tool Parameters</h2><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Face Mill E100 Example: Diameter, Length, and Effective Length</h3><br><p>Let's take a look. The creation method is quite simple.</p><br><p>Let's examine what this means. For example, the first one is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E100</strong>. The meaning of E100, frankly, refers to its <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">diameter</strong>.</p><br><p>Look, if sometimes it doesn't display, you can click somewhere else, then click on this <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E100</strong> again, and the tool will reappear.</p><br><p>The <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">diameter</strong> is 100, meaning the entire diameter of this tool is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">100 mm</strong>.</p><br><p>At this point, we can double-click to open it, or right-click and 'Edit', both work. I'm used to double-clicking to open it.</p><br><p>Double-click to open. After opening, let's look at this area.</p><br><p>The <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">diameter</strong> is 100. Clearly, this tool's diameter is 100 mm. The bottom diameter is 0. These others are also 0; we can ignore them.</p><br><p>The <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">length</strong> is 75 mm. Simply put, the total length of this tool is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">75 mm</strong>. And the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">effective length</strong> is 50 mm, which means the distance from this point to this point is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">50 mm</strong>.</p><br><p>Of course, as you all know, what E100 means is that it's a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">face mill</strong>, a face mill with a 100 mm diameter.</p><br><p>Its bottom radius is 0, which means it should typically be <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E100 R0.8</strong>. Usually, the inserts for these tools have a small corner radius of <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">R0.8</strong>. So, it's a tool like E100 R0.8. Why did I set the bottom corner radius to 0? We'll discuss that later when we get to programming. For now, just understand what this tool represents.</p><br><p>This face mill has a total length of 75 mm and an effective length of 50 mm.</p><br><p>You might ask, how can the effective length be 50 mm? Because for insert tools, the insert itself isn't 50 mm long. The point here is that we <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">can give it an approximate value</strong>. You don't need to create it to be exactly identical to the physical tool. We only need to create the approximate size of the tool, and that's sufficient.</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Tool Positioning and Machining Simulation</h3><br><p>Now, by default, whenever we open the tool, it will appear in this position. We can click and hold the left mouse button to drag it, or simply click on a specific spot on the screen to place the tool there.</p><br><p>What is this actually for? Simply put, we can place it, for example, approximately here. Then we can check if a single pass of this tool can cover the entire area. This is the edge, and this is the edge. If it starts cutting from here, moves along, and then comes over, can one pass cover it? Clearly, it can. A 100 mm tool can cover this area.</p><br><p>Okay, when we reach this position, there's a significant amount of material here. You also know what this means. It means our tool is too large to machine this corner radius. In such a situation, we would definitely need another type of tool to perform <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">corner cleanup</strong>. Just understand this concept.</p><br><p>We can't machine all the way to this point, right? If we did, we'd be overcutting this area.</p><br><p>The purpose of this is simply for reference. It allows us to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">check if the tool is large enough, or if it's suitable, if we can use this tool</strong>. Just take a look, a rough look. But for the final selection, you also need to check what tools you actually have available.</p><br><p>You can click anywhere; clicking here or on that corner, both are fine.</p><br><p>Alright, so this is about how to change or view our tools. Roughly, there's also the length and effective length. That's good. Let's move on.</p><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Quick Tool Creation and Modification (Critical Pitfalls)</h2><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">E-Series Face Mills: Copying, Renaming, and Parameter Modification</h3><br><p>For example, now we have <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E59, E90, E80, E63, E40</strong>. All of these are <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">insert tools</strong> (face mills with removable inserts). Any tool starting with 'E' is typically an insert-type tool. E25, E21, E20, E17, E16.</p><br><p>For instance, let's say we want to create an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E15</strong> tool. How do we create it?</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Right-click, Copy</strong>. Then directly click <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Paste</strong>. Good.</p><br><p>Now, this tool and the original one are actually identical. It's just like copying and pasting any other item, like a folder or anything else. The copied and pasted items will definitely be identical.</p><br><p>We need to modify the pasted tool. Right-click. Why is there English at the end? Because their names cannot be duplicates.</p><br><p>For example, for E17, just change the '6' to '7', and press Enter. See, now you have an E17 tool, right?</p><br><p>Oh, for E15. Right-click, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Rename</strong>. We'll take this position, you can drag it a bit, and change it to '5'. Okay.</p><br><p>Can it be used now? We copied it and changed its name to E15. Is this correct? Absolutely not!</p><br><p>Although its name has been changed to E15, this tool is still a 16 mm tool. Everyone, please, please, please remember this: <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">just renaming the tool's display name to E15 does not make it an E15 tool</strong>. That's impossible. You must <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">double-click to open it</strong>, then go to the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Diameter</strong> field and enter <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">15</strong>. Good, then press Enter. That's all. Of course, there are other parameters like tool holder, etc., but for now, we don't need to worry about them. We just need to make sure the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">diameter</strong> is correctly set. The length and effective length have already been discussed.</p><br><p>Right-click, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">OK</strong>. Only now is this tool truly an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E15</strong> tool. Double-click to open and check again. 15, correct. OK.</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">R-Corner Radius Tools: Distinguishing E90R0.8 and E63R6</h3><br><p>Let's look at the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E90 R0.8</strong> below. Actually, this one and the E90 are quite similar. But the R0.8 indicates that at this position, there is a small corner radius. This position has an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">R0.8</strong>.</p><br><p>Why are these two types of tools so similar? It's simply my personal habit for future programming; I might need both. We'll discuss that later. For now, there's no need to explain it so thoroughly; we just need to understand what these tools mean.</p><br><p>We also have <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E63 R6</strong>. Everyone knows this type of tool, right? It's an E63 face mill with an R6 insert. This is an R6 insert, quite large, a round type of insert.</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E63 R0.8</strong> is a square-ish insert.</p><br><p>These are all self-explanatory, and the differences are quite clear.</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">D-Series End Mills: Similarities and Differences with E-Series</h3><br><p>For example, for an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E25 R5</strong> tool, we copy it, and then paste it.</p><br><p>Suppose we want to create an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E26 R5</strong>. Just create a random one.</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Rename</strong>. The first step is to rename it. <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E26 R5</strong>. Delete all the English characters at the end, then press Enter.</p><br><p>At this point, we double-click to open it. <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E26 R5</strong>. We don't need to change the 'R' value.</p><br><p>Let's say, for example, you don't want to confirm directly now. Suppose you realize you made a mistake with this tool in your work. You can double-click to open it. For example, if you want to create an <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">R4</strong> tool. You change it to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">4</strong>. You must press Enter. If you change it to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">5</strong>, you have to press Enter. When you preview this 'R' value, for example, if you input <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">1</strong>, press Enter. Okay, now this position is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">1</strong>. You must press Enter; it's a habit. Enter. Okay, Enter, Enter.</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">R4</strong>, Enter.</p><br><p>Don't worry about the effective length or anything else; just click <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">OK</strong>. But you must <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">rename</strong> it from '5' to '4', because you've already changed the internal parameters to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E26 R4</strong>, so the external name also needs to be updated. OK.</p><br><p>This is a quick way to create a tool. This method of creating tools, I think, is quite convenient; you just copy and paste.</p><br><p>All tools starting with <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E</strong> are typically insert tools (face mills).</p><br><p>Now, what about tools starting with <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D</strong>? These are actually <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">end mills</strong>. They are not insert tools, meaning they can machine with their side cutting edge as well. I believe everyone has seen this type of tool in the machine shop. You've definitely seen them.</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D35 R3</strong> means a 35 mm end mill with an R3 corner radius, very clear. <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D14 R1.5</strong> means a 14 mm end mill with an R1.5 corner radius.</p><br><p>For example, how do you create this? The creation method is exactly the same as what we just did.</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Summary: Pitfall Avoidance Guide</h3><br><p>Listen up, Master Wang emphasizes again:</p><br><ol><br><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Name vs. Parameters</strong>: In Siemens NX, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">renaming a tool's display name (label) does not automatically change its actual machining parameters!</strong> You must double-click to open the tool properties, manually modify core parameters like diameter, length, and corner radius, then press Enter to confirm, and finally click OK for the changes to take effect. This is the most common pitfall for beginners.</li><br><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">The 'Approximate' Rule for Effective Length</strong>: For a tool's 'effective length' (or cutting length), especially for non-standard tools or face mills, providing <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">an approximate value that meets machining requirements is sufficient</strong> in the model. There's no need to demand 100% exact match with the physical tool. The software model is mainly for visual simulation and toolpath calculation.</li><br><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Machine View for Visual Verification</strong>: Use the Machine View to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">visually check if the tool's size is appropriate</strong>, if it can cover the machining area, and if there's any risk of overcutting. Don't just rely on software simulation; you need to envision the cutting sparks! While this is virtual, this way of thinking is fundamental to practical machining.</li><br><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Significance of Corner Radius (R-Value)</strong>: Understand the meaning of the R-value in tool names (e.g., R0.8, R6). It represents the corner radius of the tool's cutting edge. Different R-values correspond to different insert shapes and machining characteristics (sharp corner, rounded corner), which are crucial for corner cleanup and contour milling.</li><br><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">E-Series vs. D-Series</strong>: Familiarize yourself with common tool prefix conventions in Siemens NX. Typically, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">'E' series</strong> often refers to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">face mills / indexable face mills</strong> (Face Mill) with replaceable inserts, suitable for roughing flat surfaces. <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">'D' series</strong> often refers to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">end mills / ball nose end mills</strong> (End Mill/Ball Nose), commonly used for side milling or finish contour milling.</li><br><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Importance of Templates</strong>: Your tool library should be built upon <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">standard templates</strong>. The initial tool list comes from your programming template. Learning to manage and customize templates can greatly improve efficiency.</li><br></ol>

> 课题：UG NX 1980 机床视图刀具的运用

<br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">引言：编程前的刀具基础</h2><br><p>大家好，我是王工。我们上一节课讲了程序顺序视图。那些内容，比如这个位置，我们都说过了。你们不用把所有的都记住，它究竟是干什么的。但是字面意思，我们一定要能够看得懂。</p><br><p>接下来我们编程的时候，可能慢慢地，你就会把这些大概的、所有的，一点一点地都会特别的熟悉，就不用再思考这个究竟是做什么用的了。所以说这个时侯，我们先大概了解一下就行了。</p><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">核心功能：机床视图与刀具可视化</h2><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">机床视图的启用与作用</h3><br><p>这个，之前说过了，我们看一下它下面这个，叫做<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">机床视图</strong>。我们直接点一下就可以了。</p><br><p>主要啊，这个位置你也可以看得到它究竟是什么意思啊，在<strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">工序导航器</strong>中显示机床视图。这个意思，其实说白了，就是你可以把这个机床给显示出来，然后看那个机床是怎么运动，就是加工我们这个零件嘛，这些刀轨，怎么运动，都可以看得到。</p><br><p>但是我们前期学习啊，我们连这个程序都没有编出来，所以说这个我们用不上。如果想要用的话，就是<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">编辑</strong>，这个在库中调入机床，就可以去找很多很多的机床。我们这个先不说啊。</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">理解刀具列表：模板与自定义</h3><br><p>我们要说的是下面这些。可以看一下，往后拉，这个可以往下拖拽。一直到下面，这些究竟是什么意思呢？我相信啊，大家可能有所了解了，一看就懂了。</p><br><p>这个位置，所有的，都是我们的<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">刀具</strong>。我们的刀具放在什么地方了？全部都放在这个边上。</p><br><p>为什么有这些刀具呢？就是因为我一开始做的那个模板，你记得吗？那个模板。</p><br><p>如果想要自己添加，或者想要去删除这些刀具的时候，我们要到那个模板里面去删除或者添加。</p><br><p>怎么操作呢？请看我那个是“王工那个模板”，里面有一个“编程模板”，去那里面去看一下那个究竟是怎么制作的。</p><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">刀具参数的深度解析</h2><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">以盘刀 E100 为例：直径、长度与有效长度</h3><br><p>看一下啊，这个制作方法也是很简单。</p><br><p>我们来看一下啊，这个究竟是什么意思啊。比如第一个这个是 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E100</strong>。E100 的意思呢，就是说白了，就是我们这个<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">直径</strong>。</p><br><p>看一下啊，如果有的时侯你不显示了，可以点一下别的地方，再点一下这个 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E100</strong>，这个刀具就显示出来了。</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">直径</strong> 100，也就是它和它，这个刀具，整个的直径是 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">100</strong>。</p><br><p>这个时候我们可以双击给它打开，或者右键，编辑，都是可以的。我习惯了双击给它打开。</p><br><p>双击打开。打开了之后，我们看一下这个位置。</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">直径</strong> 100，很明显，这个刀具直径是 100。下半径没有。这几个都没有，不管它。</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">长度</strong> 啊是 75。说白了，就是我们这个刀具的总长是 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">75</strong>。然后<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">刃长</strong>是 50，就是说白了，这个位置距离这个位置是 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">50</strong>。</p><br><p>当然啊，大家也知道，这个 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E100</strong> 这个就是什么意思，就是一个<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">盘刀</strong>，直径 100 的这么一个盘刀。</p><br><p>它下半径啊，只是 0，就是说明是 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E100 R0.8</strong>。我们通常啊，那个刀具，那个刀片，都会有一个 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">R0.8</strong> 那么一个小圆角。所以说是 E100 R0.8 的这么一个刀具。为什么我给它下面的圆角改成 0 了呢？我们接下来编程的时候再说。我们现在只要知道这个刀具代表是什么意思就行。</p><br><p>这个盘刀，它的这个长度是 75，刃长是 50。</p><br><p>肯定你们会问，这个 50 怎么可能，我们这个刃长怎么可能是 50 呢？因为这个刀片嘛，它不可能有 50 那么长。这个意思呢，就是我们<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">可以大概给它一个这个数就行了</strong>。不用说你创建的跟那个刀具是一模一样的，这是不需要的。我们只需要把这个大概的这个刀具大小给它创建出来，这样就可以了。</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff;

border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">刀具的快速创建与修改（避坑核心）</h2><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">E 系列盘刀：复制、重命名与参数修改</h3><br><p>打比方，现在 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E59，E90，E80，E63，E40</strong>，这些全部都是这个<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">上刀片</strong>的。只要是 E 开头的，全部都是上刀片的这种刀具。E25，E21，E20，E17，E16。</p><br><p>比如，打比方，我们要创建一个 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E15</strong> 的刀具，该怎么去创建？</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">右键，复制</strong>。直接点击<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">粘贴</strong>。好。</p><br><p>现在这个和这个，它们两个其实一模一样的，就像我们复制粘贴一种东西一样，一个文件夹或者是别的也好。你复制的和粘贴的，它们两个肯定是一模一样的。</p><br><p>我们把粘贴的我们需要修改的，右键。为什么后面有这个英文呢？就因为它们两个名字不能重复。</p><br><p>比如 E17 的啊，只要把这个 6 改成 7，回车。哎，有 E17 的刀具是吧。</p><br><p>哦，E15 的啊。右键，<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">重命名</strong>。我们把这个，这个位置你可以这么拉一下，改称 5。好。</p><br><p>现在可以吗？它复制的它，这个位置改成 E15。这样是不是肯定不可以？</p><br><p>它这个名虽然改成了 E15，但是这把刀具还是 16 的。这个大家一定要，一定要一定要记住啊，<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">不能说你这个位置从命名改成 15，它就是 15 的刀具</strong>。这是不可能的。你必须<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">双击打开</strong>，之后我们再这个<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">直径</strong>这个位置，给它填上 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">15</strong>。好，回车就可以了。当然上面这些什么刀柄加持器，更多，我们先目前来说我们先不用管它，我们只需要把这个<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">直径</strong>给整明白就可以了。长度和刃长已经说过了。</p><br><p>右键，<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">确定</strong>。这个时候我们这把刀具才是 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E15</strong> 的刀具。双击打开再检查一下啊，15，正确。确定。</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">R 圆角刀具：E90R0.8 与 E63R6 的区分</h3><br><p>看一下下面的 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E90 R0.8</strong>。其实这个和这个 E90，它们两个其实差不多。但是这个 R0.8，就是这个位置，有一个小圆角。这个位置就是 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">R0.8</strong>。</p><br><p>为什么两种刀具它如此之像啊？就是我们未来编程的时候，这是我自己的习惯，未来编程的时候我可能用得到。到时候我们再说。现在不用说得那么明白，我们只要知道，只要认识到这些刀具究竟什么意思就可以了。</p><br><p>这个还有 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E63 R6</strong> 的。这种刀具大家都知道吧？就是 E63 的盘刀，R6 的那种刀片。这种就是 R6 的刀片嘛，还挺大的，圆的那种刀片。</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E63 R0.8</strong> 的，是这种方的这种刀片。</p><br><p>这个都字面意思，看着也是比较清楚。</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">D 系列立铣刀：与 E 系列的异同</h3><br><p>比如这个 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E25 R5</strong> 的这种刀具，我们复制一下，然后之后粘贴。</p><br><p>假如创建一个 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E26 R5</strong> 的吧，就是随便创建一个。</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">重命名</strong>，第一步就是重命名。<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E26 R5</strong>，后面这些英文全部删除了，回车。</p><br><p>这个位置，我们双击打开。<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E26 R5</strong>。这个 R 我们不需要改。</p><br><p>打个比方，现在不想直接确定。比如这把刀，你发现你工作当中，你发现你建错了，不想要这把刀。双击可以打开了。</p><br><p>我们比如你想建一个 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">R4</strong> 的。哎，给它改成 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">4</strong>。哎，回车一下，必须要回车啊。比如改成 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">5</strong>，你得按下回车。你按一下预览到这个 R，比如输 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">1</strong>，回车。好，这个位置就是 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">1</strong>。必须要回车一下啊，习惯性，回车。好，回车，回车。</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">R4</strong>，回车。</p><br><p>刃长什么都不用管，我们只点<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">确定</strong>。但是你一定要把这个<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">重命名</strong>，把 5 改成 4，因为你里面已经改成 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E26 R4</strong> 的，所以外面都要需要更改。确定。</p><br><p>这个呢，就是快速的创建这么一把刀具。这个创建刀具的话这个方式，我觉得还是比较方便的，直接复制粘贴就可以了。</p><br><p>这个是 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E</strong> 开头的，所有的全部都是上刀片的。</p><br><p>那下面这些 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D</strong> 开头的，这个是什么意思呢？其实就是<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">立铣刀</strong>的意思，就是<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">不下刀片</strong>的，用侧刃也可以去加工的那种刀具。我们在那个，比如在机床那，我相信大家都见过这种刀具。肯定是见过的。</p><br><p><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D35 R3</strong> 的，就是 35 R3 的刀，很明显。<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D14 R1.5</strong>，就是 14 R1.5 的立铣刀。</p><br><p>比如这个怎么创建呢？其实创建方法跟我们刚才一模一样的。</p><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">总结：避坑指南</h3><br><p>听好了，王工再强调一遍：</p><br><ol><br><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">名称与参数分离</strong>：在 UG NX 中，<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">重命名刀具的显示名称（标签）并不会自动更改其实际加工参数！</strong> 你必须双击打开刀具属性，手动修改如直径、长度、圆角等核心参数，然后按回车确认，再点击确定才能生效。这是新手最容易踩的坑。</li><br><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">有效长度的“大概”原则</strong>：对于刀具的“刃长”（或称有效切削长度），特别是非标刀具或盘刀，在建模时给出<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">一个接近的、能满足加工需求的数值即可</strong>，不必苛求与物理刀具百分百一致。软件模型主要用于视觉模拟和刀路计算。</li><br><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">机床视图辅助判断</strong>：利用机床视图来<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">直观检查刀具的尺寸是否合适</strong>，能否覆盖加工区域，以及是否存在过切风险。别光看软件模拟，要看切削火花！虽然这里是虚拟，但这种思考方式是实战派的根本。</li><br><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">R 角的意义</strong>：理解刀具名称中 R 值（如 R0.8, R6）的含义，它代表了刀具刃部的圆角半径。不同的 R 角对应不同的刀片形状和加工特性（方刃、圆弧刃），在清角和曲面加工中至关重要。</li><br><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">E 系列 vs. D 系列</strong>：熟悉 UG NX 中常见刀具前缀的约定，通常 <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">E 开头</strong>多指可换刀片的<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">盘刀/面铣刀</strong>（Face Mill），适合平面开粗；<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D 开头</strong>则多指<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">立铣刀/球头刀</strong>（End Mill/Ball Nose），常用于侧铣或曲面精加工。</li><br><li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">模板的重要性</strong>：你的刀具库应当建立在<strong style="color:#e46c0a;">标准模板</strong>之上。初始的刀具列表来源于你的编程模板。学会管理和自定义模板，能极大提高效率。</li><br></ol>
