<p>Hello everyone, I'm Master Wang. Today, let's talk about hole milling in NX. Don't underestimate a small hole; there's a lot of expertise involved. A slight oversight can lead to a broken tool or even a scrapped workpiece. Listen up, I'm going to break down my 15 years of experience and explain it thoroughly to you.</p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Hole Milling Strategies: Helical First</h2><br><br><p>We've pretty much covered the specialized hole features combined with the bottom surfaces we discussed previously. Select a hole, machine it, and you're done. But have you noticed that it defaults to a single pass, spiraling down along the outer contour? If the hole is small, or if you've pre-drilled a pilot hole and left some stock, a single milling pass works fine.</p>
<br><br><p>However, if you encounter a larger hole that cannot be covered in one pass, the default hole milling mode can be a bit awkward. In such cases, I often tell my apprentices: <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Don't stubbornly stick to hole milling; if it's not working, switch to Planar Milling!</strong> Treat the hole as a planar region and use the Roughing mode of Planar Milling; you can still achieve the desired result, and often with higher efficiency. Why? Because what is the Hole Milling command best at? It's about <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">spiraling from top to bottom in a single pass</strong> to clean out the hole. That's its specialty!</p>
<br><br><p>But then again, it's Siemens NX; it has many functions. Hole milling can actually achieve similar results to planar milling, but it depends on how you adjust the parameters. Let's start with the most commonly used "Helical" mode.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC37%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/mastering-hole-milling-strategies-and-top-01.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第37节课  三轴/mastering-hole-milling-strategies-and-top-01.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Detailed Explanation of Helical Cutting Mode</h3><br><br><p>This "Helical" mode is my preferred choice and one I often select in my NX templates. It's efficient and provides stable cutting. It's the default, so you can generally use it directly without overthinking. We'll mainly look at the following parameters:</p>
<br><br><h4 style="color:#e46c0a;">Axial Distance (Step-down)</h4><br><p>This <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Axial Distance</strong>, simply put, is how much Depth of Cut (DOC) you take downwards with each helical turn. For example, if I set it to 0.3 mm, the toolpath will be dense, and the cutting force will be uniform. If you set it to 1 mm, the toolpath becomes sparse, and the Depth of Cut (DOC) suddenly increases. <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Especially with hard materials, uneven tool loading can easily lead to chipped edges or even direct tool breakage!</strong> Therefore, this parameter must be determined based on your tool material, workpiece material, and machine rigidity. Don't just rely on software simulations; observe the actual cutting sparks and sounds!</p>
<br><br><h4 style="color:#e46c0a;">Number of Radial Passes (Helical Turns)</h4><br><p>Next is the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Number of Passes</strong>. For this parameter, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">I advise you not to mess with it normally!</strong> Set it to 1. If you set it to 2, 10, etc., it will divide the milling into several layers. After milling one layer, it will retract the tool, then mill the next layer. This results in <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">too many air cutting moves, significantly reducing efficiency, and the impacts from retracting and re-engaging the tool also increase tool wear.</strong> What are we aiming for? <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">One continuous pass, clean and decisive!</strong></p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第37节课  三轴/mastering-hole-milling-strategies-and-top-02.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h4 style="color:#e46c0a;">Radial Distance (Toolpath Offset)</h4><br><p>This <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Radial Distance</strong> parameter is quite interesting. The default is 0, meaning it completes one turn. If you set a value, say 10 mm, it will add another pass or several passes on the outer circumference, effectively milling the hole larger. This is precisely to address the issue mentioned earlier, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">where a tool cannot mill a large hole in a single pass.</strong> It will first helical mill the interior, then retract the tool, and then helical mill another circle, offset by 10 mm from the outside. Although this method involves one more tool retraction than a single continuous pass, for large holes that cannot be covered in one go, it's more flexible than simple planar milling, especially when high verticality of the hole wall is required.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC37%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/mastering-hole-milling-strategies-and-top-02.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><br><p>Remember, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">these parameters are not rigid; they depend on the size of your chosen tool, the hole diameter, and your cutting strategy.</strong> If your set radial distance is greater than the stock remaining for the hole, there will be no room for additional passes, and the software will optimize it out.</p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Key Parameters: Top and Bottom Offset</h2><br><br><p>Next, let's discuss two very practical parameters that many newcomers overlook but are crucial for protecting tools and ensuring machining quality: Top Offset and Bottom Offset.</p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第37节课  三轴/mastering-hole-milling-strategies-and-top-03.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Top Offset: The Tool's "Soft Landing"</h3><br><br><p>I'm telling you, this <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Top Offset</strong> is extremely important! It means that the tool will perform <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">an additional air cut for a certain distance above the actual machining top surface</strong> before formally starting to cut. For example, if you set it to 10 mm, the tool will start its helical motion 10 mm above the hole's top surface and then gradually cut downwards. Why do we do this?</p>
<br><ol><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Tool Protection:</strong> Especially when milling hard materials, if you let the tool "plunge" directly into the workpiece surface to start cutting, the impact force is very high, and the tool tip can easily chip. With Top Offset, the tool makes a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"soft landing,"</strong> with cutting forces gradually increasing, significantly extending tool life.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Avoid Surface Scratches:</strong> Some workpieces require high surface finish, and direct entry can leave scratches on the surface. An initial air cut allows the tool to enter a stable cutting state.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Managing Stock:</strong> If your workpiece has remaining stock on the top surface, such as a cast blank, you can adjust this parameter to have the tool start cutting from above the stock.</li><br></ol><br><p>Don't cut corners here, especially during Roughing. Setting a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">5-10 mm</strong> offset here offers significant benefits.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC37%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/mastering-hole-milling-strategies-and-top-03.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Bottom Offset: The "Refined Finish"</h3><br><br><p>If there's a Top Offset, there's naturally a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Bottom Offset</strong>. This is also easy to understand: it means the tool will <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">mill a little extra</strong> at the bottom of the hole. For example, if you set it to 5 mm, it will mill 5 mm deeper than the defined hole bottom. This parameter is mainly used to:</p>
<br><ol><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Thoroughly Clear the Bottom:</strong> Ensure that burrs and residual stock at the bottom of the hole are cleaned, especially for blind holes or holes with chamfered or filleted bottoms.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Avoid Tool Marks:</strong> Sometimes, when the tool cuts to the bottom, minor tool marks may appear due to changes in cutting force. Milling a little extra ensures a flat and smooth bottom.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Address Positioning Errors:</strong> If there are minor positioning errors in your workpiece or Z-axis errors in the machine, extending downwards a bit can compensate for these errors, ensuring the actual machining depth meets specifications.</li><br></ol><br><p>You can even input a negative value, but that would mean not milling to the design depth, which is generally not recommended. Typically, a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0.5 to 2 mm</strong> bottom offset is sufficient.</p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第37节课  三轴/mastering-hole-milling-strategies-and-top-04.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Stock and Non-Cutting Moves</h3><br><p>As for <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Side Allowance</strong> (side stock), that's straightforward: the amount left for the Finishing pass. We control the top stock through Top Offset. These are standard operations and don't require much elaboration.</p>
<br><p>In <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Non-Cutting Moves</strong>, the main focus is on the entry and exit methods. The default <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Helical Ramp</strong> or <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Arc Lead-in</strong> are generally the most suitable, allowing for smooth entry and exit into and out of the cut. This <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">prevents sudden tool impact and reduces Chatter.</strong> Unless there are special circumstances, such as an obstruction near the hole, you typically won't need to consider changing to a Linear Lead-in or similar. If the program is set up correctly, these parameters usually don't need modification.</p>

<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Other Hole Milling Modes and Entry Strategies</h2><br><br><p>NX has several other hole milling modes, such as helical out-cut, constant helical, and so on. These modes are actually similar to the Roughing strategies in Planar Milling, all designed to progressively enlarge the hole. In actual work, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">we use them less frequently, primarily relying on the combination of helical entry with Radial Distance.</strong></p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Comparison of Various Entry Methods</h3><br><p>Take tool entry, for example. <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Linear Lead-in"</strong> means plunging straight in, which creates a high impact on the tool. Unless it's a particularly soft material or the tool is a drill-mill, it's not recommended. In contrast, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Helical Ramp" and "Arc Lead-in"</strong> allow the tool to maintain stability during cutting, reducing impact. Therefore, under normal circumstances, I always have my apprentices choose helical or arc entry; it's a fundamental skill for tool protection.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Helical Out-Cut Mode</h3><br><p>There's also a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Helical Out-cut"</strong> mode, which processes the hole spiraling outwards from the center, similar to "inside-out" Roughing in Planar Milling. This mode can also be quite useful in certain situations, especially when the hole diameter is large, and the tool cannot machine the entire hole in one pass. Its advantage is a relatively uniform cutting load, but its drawback is a longer toolpath and potentially more air cutting moves.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Summary: Pitfall Guide</h3><br><ol><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Mode Selection:</strong> For small holes or pre-drilled holes, use the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Helical"</strong> mode for a single, continuous pass. For large holes or those that cannot be milled in one pass, prioritize <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Planar Milling"</strong> for Roughing, or use the "Helical" mode in Hole Milling combined with <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Radial Distance."</strong></li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Axial Distance (DOC):</strong> Set strictly according to material hardness, tool diameter, and machine rigidity; <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">err on the side of smaller values</strong> to prevent tool chipping.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Number of Passes:</strong> Keep at <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">1</strong>, aiming for a single, continuous pass to improve efficiency.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Top Offset:</strong> <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Essential for Roughing</strong>, providing the tool with a "soft landing" and extending tool life. The value is usually set to 5-10 mm.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Bottom Offset:</strong> Ensures a clean hole bottom and compensates for minor errors. The value is usually set to 0.5-2 mm.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Entry Method:</strong> Prioritize <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Helical Ramp" or "Arc Lead-in"</strong> for smooth tool entry, avoiding impact.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Parameter Flexibility:</strong> Memorizing parameters is useless; <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">the core is to understand the machining logic behind each parameter and its impact on actual cutting</strong>, then adjust flexibly according to practical conditions.</li><br></ol><br><p>Alright, that's all for today.
