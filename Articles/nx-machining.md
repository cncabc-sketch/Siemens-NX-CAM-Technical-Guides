<p>Hello everyone, Master Wang here. Today, let's continue our discussion on <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">boundary control</strong> in planar profile milling within Siemens NX programming. Don't let this seem like a minor detail; in actual production, misunderstanding this can lead to serious consequences!</p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Core Pain Point: Improper Boundary Handling Compromises Machining Quality</h2><br><p>My apprentices, when they first started, often messed up due to improper boundary handling. Either the <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">workpiece wasn't milled completely</strong>, or <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">tool entry marks were too noticeable</strong>, or worse, they'd directly cause a <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">tool crash or damage the workpiece</strong>. These aren't things you learn from a textbook; you truly understand them by getting your hands dirty next to the machine.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Milling Strategy Selection: The Trade-off Between Arc and Linear Tool Entry</h3><br><p>Listen up. The program's default tool entry method, especially when encountering <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">sharp corners or narrow areas</strong>, can easily cause problems if you use <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">linear tool entry</strong>. The cutter plunges straight down or moves directly in, leading to obvious tool marks on the machined surface, and even <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">excessive Depth of Cut (DOC) or burrs</strong> at corners. This is especially true when machining tough materials like <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">titanium alloys or high-temperature nickel-based alloys</strong>; the chatter and tool wear will be unbearable!</p>
<br><p>That's why I usually change the tool entry method from linear to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">arc tool entry</strong>. An arc transition is much smoother, effectively reducing impact during tool entry, protecting the tool, and improving machined surface quality. This small change can save you a lot in rework and tool costs.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Traditional Extension Method: Limitations of Modifying the Sketch</h3><br><p>You might ask, "Master Wang, why don't I just <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">extend</strong> the machining boundary line directly in the sketch?" Yes, that's right. Like we learned before with the "Curve Length" function, you can simply extend the curve outwards by <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">2 mm</strong>, and the toolpath will naturally extend. This works fine for <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">simple chamfers</strong> or <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">single operations</strong>.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC27%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-machining-01.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p>However, this method has a major drawback:</p>
<br><ol><br>    <li>You've modified the original sketch. If this sketch is <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">shared by multiple operations</strong>, or if there are <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">other modeling requirements</strong> later on, your change could mess up other areas. This is what we call <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">strong parametric associativity, leading to high modification risk</strong>.</li><br>    <li>What's worse, if you <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">delete that extended auxiliary line</strong>, or accidentally rename it, your planar profile milling operation will instantly <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">turn red</strong>! That means the program can't find the reference geometry anymore, rendering it useless. Don't just rely on the software simulation; make sure it can actually cut material.</li><br></ol><br><p>So, I generally make it a habit to put all these <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">auxiliary lines and construction geometry</strong> into a <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">separate layer</strong>, like layer <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">253</strong>, which I commonly use. This way, it doesn't affect the main model and is easier to manage.</p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第27节课  三轴/nx-machining-01.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Siemens NX Part Boundary Operations Explained: Say Goodbye to "Red Programs"</h2><br><p>What we're going to learn is how to control boundaries <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">within the machining operation itself</strong>. This way, you <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">don't have to touch the original geometry</strong>, and your program won't easily "turn red."</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Locating the "Part Boundary" Function</h3><br><p>Double-click your planar profile milling operation and find the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Part Boundary"</strong> option. Click it, and you'll see the machining boundary lines currently selected for your operation. Initially, the program might only have one selected; for clarity, we can select a few more. In the list, clicking any line will cause it to <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">highlight</strong>.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Activating the "Trim and Extend" Function</h3><br><p>Once you've <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">selected and highlighted a specific line</strong> in the "Part Boundary" list, you'll notice a new function appears below: <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Trim and Extend."</strong> Pay attention: <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">this function only activates when a line is selected and highlighted</strong>; otherwise, you'll be looking for it forever. Many newcomers get confused here.</p>

<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第27节课  三轴/nx-machining-02.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Hands-on Operation: Precisely Extending Boundary Lines</h3><br><p>After activating "Trim and Extend," you'll see a <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">circle</strong>. This circle is what you use to control extension or trimming. You can:</p>
<br><ol><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Directly Drag</strong>: Just like dragging a line segment in CAD, pull the circle outwards to extend the toolpath; pull it inwards to trim the toolpath.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Enter a Value</strong>: Directly input the desired extension or trim amount into the input box, for example, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"2" mm</strong>. After confirming, the toolpath will follow your command.</li><br></ol><br><p>Remember this: the <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">extension amount cannot be too small</strong>. If it's too small for the tool to effectively engage, the machine will alarm out! This function allows you to extend or trim the <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">toolpath</strong> <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">without modifying the original geometry</strong>, so the program certainly won't "turn red." Talk about peace of mind!</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Tool Offsetting Selection: The Difference Between "Tangent" and "Open"</h3><br><p>Next to "Trim and Extend," you'll also see a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Tool Position"</strong> option, with two important choices: <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Tangent"</strong> and <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Open."</strong></p>
<br><ul><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Tangent</strong>: This means the tool will cut along your selected boundary curve, <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">either on the outside or inside, while remaining tangent to the curve</strong>. This is the most common method, ensuring machining accuracy and surface quality.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Open</strong>: This essentially means <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">"Trace"</strong>, where the tool center will directly <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">follow the curve you've selected</strong>. It's typically used for special machining scenarios, such as when you need the tool's centerline to strictly follow a path, or in certain roughing operations. But be careful! This means the <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">tool will cut directly on your boundary line</strong>. If you haven't left any stock, your part will be scrapped!</li><br></ul><br><p>Don't mix these two up. In real-world machining, especially for finishing passes, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Tangent" is your go-to option</strong>.</p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Customized Cutting Parameters: Making Every Edge "Obey"</h2><br><p>Beyond extending and trimming, we can also apply <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">individual parameter control</strong> to <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">each machining boundary line</strong>. This function is a true gem when dealing with complex parts!</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC27%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-machining-03.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第27节课  三轴/nx-machining-03.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Understanding "Customize Member Data"</h3><br><p>Within the "Part Boundary" function, select the line you want to adjust, then click <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Customize Member Data."</strong> Once this option opens, you'll see the unique parameter settings for that specific line.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Stock Control: Fine-Tuned to Each Machining Line</h3><br><p>The most important setting here is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Stock."</strong> Normally, the stock we set applies globally to the entire operation. But here, you can set an <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">independent stock value</strong> for <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">each individual line</strong>. For example, if you have two boundary lines, one needs <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">10 mm</strong> of stock for roughing, and the other only <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">1 mm</strong> for a finishing pass, you can precisely control that here. This is a game-changer when machining <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">asymmetrical or complex parts</strong>, or when you need <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">multi-step finishing</strong>. Don't underestimate these few millimeters of stock; they determine the <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">machining difficulty and accuracy</strong> for your next operation!</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Tolerance and Feed Rate: The Value of Individual Adjustment</h3><br><p>Besides stock, you also have <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Tolerance"</strong> and <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Cutting Feedrate"</strong> here. While in practice we usually only manage stock, understanding these options gives you more tools to handle special situations. For instance, if a specific boundary segment requires higher precision, you can reduce its tolerance; if a segment experiences a heavy cutting load, you can even adjust its feed rate individually to ensure machining safety and extend tool life.</p>
<br><p>However, newcomers, you must distinguish that these parameters apply only to the <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">currently selected line</strong>, not to the entire operation! Mess this up, and once the program runs, your part is scrapped. It's simply not worth it.</p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第27节课  三轴/nx-machining-04.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Master Wang's Experience: Boundary Universality in Planar Milling vs. Planar Profile Milling</h2><br><p>Today, we've focused primarily on planar profile milling, but I want to add that the logic behind many functions in NX is interconnected.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC27%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-machining-04.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Functional Interface Consistency</h3><br><p>If you open the <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Planar Mill</strong> operation and look at its parameters for <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">boundary extension, trimming, and alignment</strong>, you'll find they are <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">almost identical</strong> to those in planar profile milling. The functions, methods, and values are all the same. This indicates that when Siemens NX designed these commands, universality was considered, making it convenient for us machinists.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Distinguishing Application Scenarios</h3><br><p>So, if they're so similar, why differentiate between planar milling and planar profile milling? It's simple:</p>
<br><ul><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Planar Mill</strong>: Typically used for <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">roughing</strong> or machining <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">flat areas</strong>, focusing on efficiency and material removal.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Planar Profile Mill</strong>: It excels at machining <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">sidewalls and profiles</strong>. It can perform a <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">finishing pass</strong> (for side walls) or even roughing on sidewalls. It requires more precise boundary control to ensure the final profile shape and surface quality.</li><br></ul><br><p>Therefore, although the functions are similar, in practical application, you must choose the appropriate command based on your <strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">machining goals and workpiece characteristics</strong>. Using the right command gets the job done efficiently; using the wrong one often leads to rework or scrapped parts.</p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Summary: A Guide to Avoiding Traps</h3><br><ol><br>    <li>**Prioritize Internal Program Boundary Control**: Don't easily modify the original sketch; avoid parametric chaos and "red programs."</li><br>    <li>**Arc Tool Entry is King**: Especially for finishing passes and difficult-to-machine materials, arc tool entry effectively protects the tool and improves surface quality.</li><br>    <li>**Differentiate Between "Tangent" and "Open"**: For finishing passes, choose "Tangent." Unless you have a specific requirement, do not use "Open" – it will scrap your part!</li><br>    <li>**Make Good Use of "Customize Member Data"**: Set different stock allowances for different boundary lines to achieve precise machining and enhance process flexibility.</li><br>    <li>**Understand Universality vs. Specificity**: While many function interfaces are similar, be clear about each command's actual application scenario; don't misapply them.</li><br></ol><br><p>Alright, that's all for today. These are the real skills I, Master Wang, have painstakingly developed over fifteen years on the shop floor. I hope you can digest this well and avoid unnecessary detours! See you next time!</p>
