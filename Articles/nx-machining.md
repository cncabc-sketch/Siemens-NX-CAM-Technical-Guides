<h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Master Wang's Insight: The Practical Essence of 2D Dynamic Milling</h2><br><p><br>    Hello everyone, I'm Master Wang. Today, no fluff, just practical insights! Many ask me, 'Master Wang, what's the real difference between 'Planar Milling' and '2D Dynamic Milling' in NX, and how can we use them efficiently?' Listen up! Today, I'm going to break it down for you, revealing practical tips you won't find in textbooks!<br></p>
<br><p><br>    There's a command in NX called “Solid Profile 3D”—we'll set that aside for now, it's a bit complex. Today, let's dive straight into <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">2D Dynamic Milling</strong>, also known as <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">2D Adaptive Milling</strong> in NX. Different names, but the principle and objective are the same: during <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Roughing</strong>, it aims to create smoother toolpaths, minimize sudden changes in cutting force, and improve both efficiency and tool life.<br></p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Key Change: From "Follow Periphery" to "Adaptive Milling"</h3><br><p><br>    Previously, with Planar Milling, toolpaths were typically parallel, and the cutting pattern was often <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Follow Periphery"</strong>. When encountering corners, the tool would suddenly engage with a full Depth of Cut, leading to chipping. 2D Dynamic Milling is different; its biggest and most crucial change lies in its <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">cutting pattern</strong>.<br></p>
<br><p><br>    Select 2D Dynamic Milling (or 2D Adaptive Milling), and you'll find its interface is almost identical to Planar Milling. That's right, it evolved from Planar Milling. But, if you click in and change the cutting pattern from "Follow Periphery" to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Adaptive Milling"</strong>, this feature completely transforms!<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC31%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-machining-01.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>    Changing just this one parameter alters the tool's cutting method. It strives to maintain a constant cutting width, using small Stepover and high feed rates to create a "peeling" type of toolpath. This effectively prevents the tool from engaging with a full Depth of Cut, making it particularly suitable for <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">deep pocket Roughing</strong> and <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">hard material machining</strong>.<br></p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Toolpath Boundaries and Floor Definition</h3><br><p><br>    Defining the toolpath range is similar to Planar Milling.<br>    <ul><br>        <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Part Boundaries:</strong> Specify the boundary curves of the area you want to machine. Make sure to select them precisely; don't over-mill or under-mill.</li><br>        <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Floor:</strong> Select the bottom face for machining. This face defines your machining depth. Beginners often make mistakes here; selecting the wrong one can lead to over-machining (milling through) or not reaching the desired depth. Remember, choose the face you ultimately intend to machine to.</li><br>    </ul><br>    For the tool, just pick a common one for now, like a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">D10 end mill</strong> (10mm diameter). Generate the program first, and then we'll fine-tune it step-by-step.<br></p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第31节课  三轴/nx-machining-01.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Simulation: Avoiding the "No Stock" Pitfall</h2><br><p><br>    Alright, the program is generated. Let's run a simulation to check the results. Click "Tool Path Verification" and then select <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">3D Simulation</strong>. You might find it throws an error! It'll say "No Stock" or fail to simulate. This is a common pitfall for many beginners, and textbooks often don't tell you about it.<br></p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">NX 2D Program Simulation Pain Point: Doesn't Recognize Solids, Only Wires</h3><br><p><br>    Why the error? Because <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">2D programs, like Planar Milling, only recognize wires, not solids</strong>. They don't know what your stock looks like, so they can't perform a 3D solid cutting simulation. If you click 'Simulate' directly at this point, the system gets "confused".<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC31%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-machining-02.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第31节课  三轴/nx-machining-02.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Master Wang's Secret: Add a "Floor Wall Milling" Operation as Stock</h3><br><p><br>    The secret to solving this is simple: before your 2D Dynamic Milling program, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">add a "Floor Wall Milling" operation</strong> to serve as your stock reference!<br>    <ol><br>        <li>Create a new "Floor Wall Milling" operation, define the part and floor arbitrarily, and select any tool.</li><br>        <li>Generate this "Floor Wall Milling" program.</li><br>        <li>Drag your 2D Dynamic Milling program underneath this "Floor Wall Milling" program.</li><br>    </ol><br>    Now, select your 2D Dynamic Milling program again and run a 3D simulation. You'll see a miracle happen! The simulation works normally! This is because <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">2D Dynamic Milling "inherits" the stock state after the "Floor Wall Milling" operation</strong>, so it now knows where to start cutting. This little trick will save you a lot of debugging time!<br></p>
<br><p><br>    Through simulation, you'll observe the tool descending in a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">helical motion</strong>, then expanding outwards within the cavity like a snail shell, with a very stable cutting process. That's the beauty of dynamic milling! It equalizes the tool's cutting load, which allows for higher cutting parameters and boosts machining efficiency.<br></p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Core Parameter Analysis: Stepover, Layers, and Retraction Control</h2><br><p><br>    NX has parameters galore, but only a few core ones truly impact machining quality and efficiency. Today, we'll focus on dynamic milling's key parameters.<br></p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第31节课  三轴/nx-machining-03.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">1. Stepover: Cutting Width and Efficiency</h3><br><p><br>    <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Stepover</strong> is the distance the tool moves sideways with each pass.<br>    <ul><br>        <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Percentage:</strong> The default is usually around <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">10%</strong> of the tool diameter. For example, for a D10 tool (10mm diameter), 10% is 1mm. This value determines your cutting width and toolpath density. A small Stepover results in dense toolpaths and a better surface finish but takes longer; a large Stepover increases efficiency but might leave uneven stock after Roughing.</li><br>        <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a; font-weight:bold;">Constant:</strong> You can also set it to a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">fixed value</strong>, such as 0.5mm. Whether to use a percentage or a fixed value depends on your tool and material. For Roughing, generally choose a larger Stepover to improve efficiency, but don't exceed 30-40% of the tool's effective cutting edge width, or it could lead to Chatter or tool breakage.</li><br>    </ul><br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC31%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-machining-03.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">2. Layers: Roughing Depth Strategy</h3><br><p><br>    <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Layers</strong>, also referred to as <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Depth per Cut</strong>, controls the tool's multi-level cutting in the Z-axis direction.<br>    <ul><br>        <li>If you set a specific value, such as "20", it will divide the total machining depth into 20 layers for processing.</li><br>        <li>However, in <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Roughing</strong>, for maximum efficiency, we usually set this value to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0</strong>. Setting it to 0 means <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">one continuous cut to depth</strong> (or "finish to floor"). The tool will helix down from the top and then machine directly to the defined floor depth, reducing retractions and layering. This is crucial for boosting efficiency in dynamic milling!</li><br>    </ul><br></p>
<br><div style="margin:35px 0; text-align:center;"><img src="IMG/第31节课  三轴/nx-machining-04.webp" style="width:100%; border-radius:15px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);" /></div><br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">3. Minimum Corner Radius: Corner Smoothness</h3><br><p><br>    This parameter is found on the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Strategy"</strong> page. It defines the minimum corner radius the tool can follow when turning.<br>    <ul><br>        <li>The default is typically <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">5%</strong> of the tool diameter. For a D10 tool (10mm diameter), this means a 0.5mm corner radius.</li><br>        <li>A larger value results in smoother corners and less force on the tool; a smaller value creates sharper corners, but the tool might experience higher forces in those areas. Typically, keeping the default is fine; consider adjusting only for specific Corner Cleanup requirements.</li><br>    </ul><br></p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">4. Retraction Control (Height & XY Transfer): Efficiency Killer or Safety Net?</h3><br><p><br>    Tool retraction is a critical aspect of machining, directly impacting idle travel time and overall efficiency.<br>    <ul><br>        <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Height:</strong> This controls the tool's retraction height when moving from one cutting area to another <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">within the same layer</strong>. The default is 1mm, meaning it retracts 1 millimeter each time. Setting this value too high increases idle travel time; setting it too low risks collision with the workpiece, which is unsafe. The default 1mm is generally sufficient.</li><br>        <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">XY Transfer / Global Retraction:</strong> This parameter typically appears as a very large percentage, such as <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">5500%</strong>. It controls the retraction strategy <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">between different cutting regions</strong> or <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">between different layers</strong>.</li><br>            <ul><br>                <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Larger Value:</strong> The tool is more inclined to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">avoid retracting</strong>, opting for "smooth connection" paths, moving quickly across the workpiece surface as much as possible, reducing the number of retractions. This is <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">KEY</strong> to boosting efficiency! I usually set it to a very high value, like <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">10000</strong>, or even <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">higher</strong>, to ensure more continuous tool motion.</li><br>                <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Smaller Value:</strong> The tool will <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">retract very frequently</strong>, even for short movements. This causes idle travel time to increase exponentially, resulting in extremely low efficiency and machining times that will drive you crazy!</li><br>            </ul><br>        Therefore, for this parameter, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">NEVER set it too low!</strong> Try to give it a large value, allowing the tool to move quickly and continuously in the XY plane, which will significantly improve your machining efficiency.<br>    </ul><br></p>
<br><br><h2 style="color:#0070c0; border-bottom:2px solid #0070c0; padding-bottom:5px; margin-top:30px;">Side Wall Corner Cleanup: Another Advantage of Dynamic Milling</h2><br><p><br>    Dynamic milling not only efficiently performs Roughing on planar surfaces but also offers unique advantages in <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">side wall Corner Cleanup</strong>. Due to its "adaptive milling" characteristics, the cutting load on the tool in corners is well-controlled, minimizing the risk of chatter marks and ensuring uniform stock for subsequent Finishing passes.<br></p>

<div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncabc-sketch/Siemens-NX-CAM-Technical-Guides/main/Articles/IMG/%E7%AC%AC31%E8%8A%82%E8%AF%BE%20%20%E4%B8%89%E8%BD%B4/nx-machining-04.webp" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:10px;"></div>

<br><p><br>    If you notice during simulation that the side walls don't show a "highlighted" sheen, it indicates that there is still stock remaining on the side walls. This is normal; Roughing aims to quickly remove most of the material, preparing for the Finishing pass. We'll cover Finishing toolpaths in detail next time.<br></p>
<br><br><h3 style="color:#3399ff; border-left:5px solid #ff9900; padding-left:10px; margin:25px 0;">Summary: Pitfall Avoidance Guide</h3><br><ul><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Essential Parameter Change:</strong> The core of 2D Dynamic Milling is to change the <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">cutting pattern</strong> to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Adaptive Milling"</strong>.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Simulation Trick:</strong> Before running a 3D simulation for a 2D program, always add a <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"Floor Wall Milling"</strong> operation beforehand as a stock reference; otherwise, it will error out.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Efficiency Boost:</strong> During Roughing, set <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Layers</strong> to <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">0</strong> (one continuous cut to depth), and adjust the Stepover appropriately based on the material and tool.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Reduce Retractions:</strong> Maximize the percentage value for <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">"XY Transfer"</strong> (or "Global Retraction"), for example, <strong style="color:#e46c0a;">10000</strong>, to ensure more continuous tool motion and reduce idle travel time.</li><br>    <li><strong style="color:#e46c0a;">Stock Check:</strong> After simulation, observe if the part surface has a "highlighted" sheen. Areas without sheen indicate remaining stock, requiring a subsequent Finishing pass.</li><br></ul><br><p><br>    These are experiences I, Master Wang, have accumulated over more than a decade in the trenches. I hope they are helpful to you, the next generation! Practice makes perfect; get your hands dirty, observe closely, and you'll become a true machining expert!<br></p>
